└─── dependencies

Note: These dependencies might be used by other targets.
      To find dependencies that are not used by any target, enable `--all-targets`.
Note: They might be false-positive.
      For example, `cargo-udeps` cannot detect usage of crates that are only used in doc-tests.
      To ignore some dependencies, write `package.metadata.cargo-udeps.ignore` in Cargo.toml.
