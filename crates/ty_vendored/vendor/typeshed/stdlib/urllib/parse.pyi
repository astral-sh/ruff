"""Parse (absolute and relative) URLs.

urlparse module is based upon the following RFC specifications.

RFC 3986 (STD66): "Uniform Resource Identifiers" by T. Berners-Lee, R. Fielding
and L.  Masinter, January 2005.

RFC 2732 : "Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's by R.Hinden, B.Carpenter
and L.Masinter, December 1999.

RFC 2396:  "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)": Generic Syntax by T.
Berners-Lee, R. Fielding, and L. Masinter, August 1998.

RFC 2368: "The mailto URL scheme", by P.Hoffman , L Masinter, J. Zawinski, July 1998.

RFC 1808: "Relative Uniform Resource Locators", by R. Fielding, UC Irvine, June
1995.

RFC 1738: "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" by T. Berners-Lee, L. Masinter, M.
McCahill, December 1994

RFC 3986 is considered the current standard and any future changes to
urlparse module should conform with it.  The urlparse module is
currently not entirely compliant with this RFC due to defacto
scenarios for parsing, and for backward compatibility purposes, some
parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained. The testcases in
test_urlparse.py provides a good indicator of parsing behavior.

The WHATWG URL Parser spec should also be considered.  We are not compliant with
it either due to existing user code API behavior expectations (Hyrum's Law).
It serves as a useful guide when making changes.

    """quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'

    Each part of a URL, e.g. the path info, the query, etc., has a
    different set of reserved characters that must be quoted. The
    quote function offers a cautious (not minimal) way to quote a
    string for most of these parts.

    RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax lists
    the following (un)reserved characters.

    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    reserved      = gen-delims / sub-delims
    gen-delims    = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
    sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                  / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

    Each of the reserved characters is reserved in some component of a URL,
    but not necessarily in all of them.

    The quote function %-escapes all characters that are neither in the
    unreserved chars ("always safe") nor the additional chars set via the
    safe arg.

    The default for the safe arg is '/'. The character is reserved, but in
    typical usage the quote function is being called on a path where the
    existing slash characters are to be preserved.

    Python 3.7 updates from using RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 to quote URL strings.
    Now, "~" is included in the set of unreserved characters.

    string and safe may be either str or bytes objects. encoding and errors
    must not be specified if string is a bytes object.

    The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to deal with
    non-ASCII characters, as accepted by the str.encode method.
    By default, encoding='utf-8' (characters are encoded with UTF-8), and
    errors='strict' (unsupported characters raise a UnicodeEncodeError).
