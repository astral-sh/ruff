"""This module provides access to the Windows registry API.

Functions:

CloseKey() - Closes a registry key.
ConnectRegistry() - Establishes a connection to a predefined registry handle
                    on another computer.
CreateKey() - Creates the specified key, or opens it if it already exists.
DeleteKey() - Deletes the specified key.
DeleteValue() - Removes a named value from the specified registry key.
EnumKey() - Enumerates subkeys of the specified open registry key.
EnumValue() - Enumerates values of the specified open registry key.
ExpandEnvironmentStrings() - Expand the env strings in a REG_EXPAND_SZ
                             string.
FlushKey() - Writes all the attributes of the specified key to the registry.
LoadKey() - Creates a subkey under HKEY_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and
            stores registration information from a specified file into that
            subkey.
OpenKey() - Opens the specified key.
OpenKeyEx() - Alias of OpenKey().
QueryValue() - Retrieves the value associated with the unnamed value for a
               specified key in the registry.
QueryValueEx() - Retrieves the type and data for a specified value name
                 associated with an open registry key.
QueryInfoKey() - Returns information about the specified key.
SaveKey() - Saves the specified key, and all its subkeys a file.
SetValue() - Associates a value with a specified key.
SetValueEx() - Stores data in the value field of an open registry key.

Special objects:

HKEYType -- type object for HKEY objects
error -- exception raised for Win32 errors

Integer constants:
Many constants are defined - see the documentation for each function
to see what constants are used, and where.

        """PyHKEY Object - A Python object, representing a win32 registry key.

        This object wraps a Windows HKEY object, automatically closing it when
        the object is destroyed.  To guarantee cleanup, you can call either
        the Close() method on the PyHKEY, or the CloseKey() method.

        All functions which accept a handle object also accept an integer --
        however, use of the handle object is encouraged.

        Functions:
        Close() - Closes the underlying handle.
        Detach() - Returns the integer Win32 handle, detaching it from the object

        Properties:
        handle - The integer Win32 handle.

        Operations:
        __bool__ - Handles with an open object return true, otherwise false.
        __int__ - Converting a handle to an integer returns the Win32 handle.
        rich comparison - Handle objects are compared using the handle value.
