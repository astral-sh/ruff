class POP3:
    """This class supports both the minimal and optional command sets.
    Arguments can be strings or integers (where appropriate)
    (e.g.: retr(1) and retr('1') both work equally well.

    Minimal Command Set:
            USER name               user(name)
            PASS string             pass_(string)
            STAT                    stat()
            LIST [msg]              list(msg = None)
            RETR msg                retr(msg)
            DELE msg                dele(msg)
            NOOP                    noop()
            RSET                    rset()
            QUIT                    quit()

    Optional Commands (some servers support these):
            RPOP name               rpop(name)
            APOP name digest        apop(name, digest)
            TOP msg n               top(msg, n)
            UIDL [msg]              uidl(msg = None)
            CAPA                    capa()
            STLS                    stls()
            UTF8                    utf8()

    Raises one exception: 'error_proto'.

    Instantiate with:
            POP3(hostname, port=110)

    NB:     the POP protocol locks the mailbox from user
            authorization until QUIT, so be sure to get in, suck
            the messages, and quit, each time you access the
            mailbox.

            POP is a line-based protocol, which means large mail
            messages consume lots of python cycles reading them
            line-by-line.

            If it's available on your mail server, use IMAP4
            instead, it doesn't suffer from the two problems
            above.
