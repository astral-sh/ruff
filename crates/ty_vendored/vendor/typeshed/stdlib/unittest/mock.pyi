    that specify the behaviour of the Mock object:

    * `spec`: This can be either a list of strings or an existing object (a
      class or instance) that acts as the specification for the mock object. If
      you pass in an object then a list of strings is formed by calling dir on
      the object (excluding unsupported magic attributes and methods). Accessing
      any attribute not in this list will raise an `AttributeError`.

      If `spec` is an object (rather than a list of strings) then
      `mock.__class__` returns the class of the spec object. This allows mocks
      to pass `isinstance` tests.

    * `spec_set`: A stricter variant of `spec`. If used, attempting to *set*
      or get an attribute on the mock that isn't on the object passed as
      `spec_set` will raise an `AttributeError`.

    * `side_effect`: A function to be called whenever the Mock is called. See
      the `side_effect` attribute. Useful for raising exceptions or
      dynamically changing return values. The function is called with the same
      arguments as the mock, and unless it returns `DEFAULT`, the return
      value of this function is used as the return value.

      If `side_effect` is an iterable then each call to the mock will return
      the next value from the iterable. If any of the members of the iterable
      are exceptions they will be raised instead of returned.

    * `return_value`: The value returned when the mock is called. By default
      this is a new Mock (created on first access). See the
      `return_value` attribute.

    * `unsafe`: By default, accessing any attribute whose name starts with
      *assert*, *assret*, *asert*, *aseert*, or *assrt* raises an AttributeError.
      Additionally, an AttributeError is raised when accessing
      attributes that match the name of an assertion method without the prefix
      `assert_`, e.g. accessing `called_once` instead of `assert_called_once`.
      Passing `unsafe=True` will allow access to these attributes.

    * `wraps`: Item for the mock object to wrap. If `wraps` is not None then
      calling the Mock will pass the call through to the wrapped object
      (returning the real result). Attribute access on the mock will return a
      Mock object that wraps the corresponding attribute of the wrapped object
      (so attempting to access an attribute that doesn't exist will raise an
      `AttributeError`).

      If the mock has an explicit `return_value` set then calls are not passed
      to the wrapped object and the `return_value` is returned instead.

    * `name`: If the mock has a name then it will be used in the repr of the
      mock. This can be useful for debugging. The name is propagated to child
      mocks.

    Mocks can also be called with arbitrary keyword arguments. These will be
    used to set attributes on the mock after it is created.

    an async function.

    The :class:`AsyncMock` object will behave so the object is
    recognized as an async function, and the result of a call is an awaitable:

    >>> mock = AsyncMock()
    >>> inspect.iscoroutinefunction(mock)
    True
    >>> inspect.isawaitable(mock())
    True


    The result of ``mock()`` is an async function which will have the outcome
    of ``side_effect`` or ``return_value``:

    - if ``side_effect`` is a function, the async function will return the
      result of that function,
    - if ``side_effect`` is an exception, the async function will raise the
      exception,
    - if ``side_effect`` is an iterable, the async function will return the
      next value of the iterable, however, if the sequence of result is
      exhausted, ``StopIteration`` is raised immediately,
    - if ``side_effect`` is not defined, the async function will return the
      value defined by ``return_value``, hence, by default, the async function
      returns a new :class:`AsyncMock` object.

    If the outcome of ``side_effect`` or ``return_value`` is an async function,
    the mock async function obtained when the mock object is called will be this
    async function itself (and not an async function returning an async
    function).

    The test author can also specify a wrapped object with ``wraps``. In this
    case, the :class:`Mock` object behavior is the same as with an
    :class:`.Mock` object: the wrapped object may have methods
    defined as async function functions.
