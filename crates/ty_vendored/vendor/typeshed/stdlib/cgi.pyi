"""Support module for CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts.

This module defines a number of utilities for use by CGI scripts
written in Python.

The global variable maxlen can be set to an integer indicating the maximum size
of a POST request. POST requests larger than this size will result in a
ValueError being raised during parsing. The default value of this variable is 0,
meaning the request size is unlimited.

    This class provides naming, typing, files stored on disk, and
    more.  At the top level, it is accessible like a dictionary, whose
    keys are the field names.  (Note: None can occur as a field name.)
    The items are either a Python list (if there's multiple values) or
    another FieldStorage or MiniFieldStorage object.  If it's a single
    object, it has the following attributes:

    name: the field name, if specified; otherwise None

    filename: the filename, if specified; otherwise None; this is the
        client side filename, *not* the file name on which it is
        stored (that's a temporary file you don't deal with)

    value: the value as a *string*; for file uploads, this
        transparently reads the file every time you request the value
        and returns *bytes*

    file: the file(-like) object from which you can read the data *as
        bytes* ; None if the data is stored a simple string

    type: the content-type, or None if not specified

    type_options: dictionary of options specified on the content-type
        line

    disposition: content-disposition, or None if not specified

    disposition_options: dictionary of corresponding options

    headers: a dictionary(-like) object (sometimes email.message.Message or a
        subclass thereof) containing *all* headers

    The class is subclassable, mostly for the purpose of overriding
    the make_file() method, which is called internally to come up with
    a file open for reading and writing.  This makes it possible to
    override the default choice of storing all files in a temporary
    directory and unlinking them as soon as they have been opened.
