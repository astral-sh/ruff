"""SMTP/ESMTP client class.

This should follow RFC 821 (SMTP), RFC 1869 (ESMTP), RFC 2554 (SMTP
Authentication) and RFC 2487 (Secure SMTP over TLS).

Notes:

Please remember, when doing ESMTP, that the names of the SMTP service
extensions are NOT the same thing as the option keywords for the RCPT
and MAIL commands!

Example:

  >>> import smtplib
  >>> s=smtplib.SMTP("localhost")
  >>> print(s.help())
  This is Sendmail version 8.8.4
  Topics:
      HELO    EHLO    MAIL    RCPT    DATA
      RSET    NOOP    QUIT    HELP    VRFY
      EXPN    VERB    ETRN    DSN
  For more info use "HELP <topic>".
  To report bugs in the implementation send email to
      sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org.
  For local information send email to Postmaster at your site.
  End of HELP info
  >>> s.putcmd("vrfy","someone@here")
  >>> s.getreply()
  (250, "Somebody OverHere <somebody@here.my.org>")
  >>> s.quit()

    """LMTP - Local Mail Transfer Protocol

    The LMTP protocol, which is very similar to ESMTP, is heavily based
    on the standard SMTP client. It's common to use Unix sockets for
    LMTP, so our connect() method must support that as well as a regular
    host:port server.  local_hostname and source_address have the same
    meaning as they do in the SMTP class.  To specify a Unix socket,
    you must use an absolute path as the host, starting with a '/'.

    Authentication is supported, using the regular SMTP mechanism. When
    using a Unix socket, LMTP generally don't support or require any
    authentication, but your mileage might vary.
