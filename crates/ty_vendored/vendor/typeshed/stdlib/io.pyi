"""The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

data:

DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE

   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
   I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
   possible.

    """The abstract base class for all I/O classes.

    This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
    derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
    represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

    Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
    their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
    consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
    may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
    called.

    The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
    bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
    In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
    I/O classes work with str data.

    Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
    which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.

    IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
    that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
    stream.

    IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
    fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

    with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:
        fp.write('Spam and eggs!')

    In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
    BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
    mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
    return None.
