        - ``order_default`` indicates whether the ``order`` parameter is
          assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
        - ``kw_only_default`` indicates whether the ``kw_only`` parameter is
          assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
        - ``frozen_default`` indicates whether the ``frozen`` parameter is
          assumed to be True or False if it is omitted by the caller.
        - ``field_specifiers`` specifies a static list of supported classes
          or functions that describe fields, similar to ``dataclasses.field()``.

        At runtime, this decorator records its arguments in the

        """Compute the annotations dict for an object.

        obj may be a callable, class, or module.
        Passing in an object of any other type raises TypeError.

        Returns a dict.  get_annotations() returns a new dict every time
        it's called; calling it twice on the same object will return two
        different but equivalent dicts.

        This is a backport of `inspect.get_annotations`, which has been
        in the standard library since Python 3.10. See the standard library
        documentation for more:

            https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.get_annotations

        This backport adds the *format* argument introduced by PEP 649. The
        three formats supported are:
        * VALUE: the annotations are returned as-is. This is the default and
          it is compatible with the behavior on previous Python versions.
        * FORWARDREF: return annotations as-is if possible, but replace any
          undefined names with ForwardRef objects. The implementation proposed by
          PEP 649 relies on language changes that cannot be backported; the
          typing-extensions implementation simply returns the same result as VALUE.
        * STRING: return annotations as strings, in a format close to the original
          source. Again, this behavior cannot be replicated directly in a backport.
          As an approximation, typing-extensions retrieves the annotations under
          VALUE semantics and then stringifies them.

        The purpose of this backport is to allow users who would like to use
        FORWARDREF or STRING semantics once PEP 649 is implemented, but who also
        want to support earlier Python versions, to simply write:

        can also be explicitly given to provide the global and local namespaces.
