        Well, do the following:
        1. figure who the user is, and then
        2. send the data as a Basic auth'ed POST.

        First we try to read the username/password from $HOME/.pypirc,
        which is a ConfigParser-formatted file with a section
        [distutils] containing username and password entries (both
        in clear text). Eg:

            [distutils]
            index-servers =
                pypi

            [pypi]
            username: fred
            password: sekrit

        Otherwise, to figure who the user is, we offer the user three
        choices:

         1. use existing login,
         2. register as a new user, or
         3. set the password to a random string and email the user.
