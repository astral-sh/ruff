Basic statistics module.

This module provides functions for calculating statistics of data, including
averages, variance, and standard deviation.

Calculating averages
--------------------

==================  ==================================================
Function            Description
==================  ==================================================
mean                Arithmetic mean (average) of data.
fmean               Fast, floating-point arithmetic mean.
geometric_mean      Geometric mean of data.
harmonic_mean       Harmonic mean of data.
median              Median (middle value) of data.
median_low          Low median of data.
median_high         High median of data.
median_grouped      Median, or 50th percentile, of grouped data.
mode                Mode (most common value) of data.
multimode           List of modes (most common values of data).
quantiles           Divide data into intervals with equal probability.
==================  ==================================================

Calculate the arithmetic mean ("the average") of data:

>>> mean([-1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 5.75])
2.625


Calculate the standard median of discrete data:

>>> median([2, 3, 4, 5])
3.5


Calculate the median, or 50th percentile, of data grouped into class intervals
centred on the data values provided. E.g. if your data points are rounded to
the nearest whole number:

>>> median_grouped([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
2.8333333333...

This should be interpreted in this way: you have two data points in the class
interval 1.5-2.5, three data points in the class interval 2.5-3.5, and one in
the class interval 3.5-4.5. The median of these data points is 2.8333...


Calculating variability or spread
---------------------------------

==================  =============================================
Function            Description
==================  =============================================
pvariance           Population variance of data.
variance            Sample variance of data.
pstdev              Population standard deviation of data.
stdev               Sample standard deviation of data.
==================  =============================================

Calculate the standard deviation of sample data:

>>> stdev([2.5, 3.25, 5.5, 11.25, 11.75])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
4.38961843444...

If you have previously calculated the mean, you can pass it as the optional
second argument to the four "spread" functions to avoid recalculating it:

>>> data = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
>>> mu = mean(data)
>>> pvariance(data, mu)
2.5


Statistics for relations between two inputs
-------------------------------------------

==================  ====================================================
Function            Description
==================  ====================================================
covariance          Sample covariance for two variables.
correlation         Pearson's correlation coefficient for two variables.
linear_regression   Intercept and slope for simple linear regression.
==================  ====================================================

Calculate covariance, Pearson's correlation, and simple linear regression
for two inputs:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> y = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>> covariance(x, y)
0.75
>>> correlation(x, y)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
0.31622776601...
>>> linear_regression(x, y)  #doctest:
LinearRegression(slope=0.1, intercept=1.5)


Exceptions
----------

A single exception is defined: StatisticsError is a subclass of ValueError.

        The *data* can be any iterable of numeric data with each value being
        exactly the midpoint of a bin.  At least one value must be present.

        The *interval* is width of each bin.

        For example, demographic information may have been summarized into
        consecutive ten-year age groups with each group being represented
        by the 5-year midpoints of the intervals:

            >>> demographics = Counter({
            ...    25: 172,   # 20 to 30 years old
            ...    35: 484,   # 30 to 40 years old

            ...    55:  22,   # 50 to 60 years old
            ...    65:   6,   # 60 to 70 years old
            ... })

        The 50th percentile (median) is the 536th person out of the 1071
        member cohort.  That person is in the 30 to 40 year old age group.

        The regular median() function would assume that everyone in the
        tricenarian age group was exactly 35 years old.  A more tenable
        assumption is that the 484 members of that age group are evenly
        distributed between 30 and 40.  For that, we use median_grouped().

            >>> data = list(demographics.elements())
            >>> median(data)
            35
            >>> round(median_grouped(data, interval=10), 1)
            37.5

        The caller is responsible for making sure the data points are separated
        by exact multiples of *interval*.  This is essential for getting a
        correct result.  The function does not check this precondition.

        Inputs may be any numeric type that can be coerced to a float during
        the interpolation step.
        """

else:

        the values 1, 2, 3, etc. actually represent the midpoint of classes
        0.5-1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5, etc. The middle value falls somewhere in
        class 3.5-4.5, and interpolation is used to estimate it.

        Optional argument ``interval`` represents the class interval, and
        defaults to 1. Changing the class interval naturally will change the

        function or cumulative distribution function from discrete samples.

        The basic idea is to smooth the data using a kernel function
        to help draw inferences about a population from a sample.

        The degree of smoothing is controlled by the scaling parameter h
        which is called the bandwidth.  Smaller values emphasize local
        features while larger values give smoother results.

        The kernel determines the relative weights of the sample data
        points.  Generally, the choice of kernel shape does not matter
        as much as the more influential bandwidth smoothing parameter.

        Kernels that give some weight to every sample point:

           normal (gauss)
           logistic
           sigmoid

        Kernels that only give weight to sample points within
        the bandwidth:

           rectangular (uniform)
           triangular
           parabolic (epanechnikov)
