"""UUID objects (universally unique identifiers) according to RFC 4122/9562.

This module provides immutable UUID objects (class UUID) and functions for
generating UUIDs corresponding to a specific UUID version as specified in
RFC 4122/9562, e.g., uuid1() for UUID version 1, uuid3() for UUID version 3,
and so on.

Note that UUID version 2 is deliberately omitted as it is outside the scope
of the RFC.

If all you want is a unique ID, you should probably call uuid1() or uuid4().
Note that uuid1() may compromise privacy since it creates a UUID containing
the computer's network address.  uuid4() creates a random UUID.

Typical usage:

    >>> import uuid

    # make a UUID based on the host ID and current time
    >>> uuid.uuid1()    # doctest: +SKIP
    UUID('a8098c1a-f86e-11da-bd1a-00112444be1e')

    # make a UUID using an MD5 hash of a namespace UUID and a name
    >>> uuid.uuid3(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, 'python.org')
    UUID('6fa459ea-ee8a-3ca4-894e-db77e160355e')

    # make a random UUID
    >>> uuid.uuid4()    # doctest: +SKIP
    UUID('16fd2706-8baf-433b-82eb-8c7fada847da')

    # make a UUID using a SHA-1 hash of a namespace UUID and a name
    >>> uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, 'python.org')
    UUID('886313e1-3b8a-5372-9b90-0c9aee199e5d')

    # make a UUID from a string of hex digits (braces and hyphens ignored)
    >>> x = uuid.UUID('{00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d0e0f}')

    # convert a UUID to a string of hex digits in standard form
    >>> str(x)
    '00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d0e0f'

    # get the raw 16 bytes of the UUID
    >>> x.bytes
    b'\\x00\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x08\\t\\n\\x0b\\x0c\\r\\x0e\\x0f'

    # make a UUID from a 16-byte string
    >>> uuid.UUID(bytes=x.bytes)
    UUID('00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d0e0f')

    # get the Nil UUID
    >>> uuid.NIL
    UUID('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')

    # get the Max UUID
    >>> uuid.MAX

class UUID:
    """Instances of the UUID class represent UUIDs as specified in RFC 4122.
    UUID objects are immutable, hashable, and usable as dictionary keys.
    Converting a UUID to a string with str() yields something in the form
    '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc'.  The UUID constructor accepts
    five possible forms: a similar string of hexadecimal digits, or a tuple
    of six integer fields (with 32-bit, 16-bit, 16-bit, 8-bit, 8-bit, and
    48-bit values respectively) as an argument named 'fields', or a string
    of 16 bytes (with all the integer fields in big-endian order) as an
    argument named 'bytes', or a string of 16 bytes (with the first three
    fields in little-endian order) as an argument named 'bytes_le', or a
    single 128-bit integer as an argument named 'int'.

    UUIDs have these read-only attributes:

        bytes       the UUID as a 16-byte string (containing the six
                    integer fields in big-endian byte order)

        bytes_le    the UUID as a 16-byte string (with time_low, time_mid,
                    and time_hi_version in little-endian byte order)

        fields      a tuple of the six integer fields of the UUID,
                    which are also available as six individual attributes
                    and two derived attributes. Those attributes are not
                    always relevant to all UUID versions:

                        The 'time_*' attributes are only relevant to version 1.

                        The 'clock_seq*' and 'node' attributes are only relevant
                        to versions 1 and 6.

                        The 'time' attribute is only relevant to versions 1, 6
                        and 7.

            time_low                the first 32 bits of the UUID
            time_mid                the next 16 bits of the UUID
            time_hi_version         the next 16 bits of the UUID
            clock_seq_hi_variant    the next 8 bits of the UUID
            clock_seq_low           the next 8 bits of the UUID
            node                    the last 48 bits of the UUID

            time                    the 60-bit timestamp for UUIDv1/v6,
                                    or the 48-bit timestamp for UUIDv7
            clock_seq               the 14-bit sequence number

        hex         the UUID as a 32-character hexadecimal string

        int         the UUID as a 128-bit integer

        urn         the UUID as a URN as specified in RFC 4122/9562

        variant     the UUID variant (one of the constants RESERVED_NCS,
                    RFC_4122, RESERVED_MICROSOFT, or RESERVED_FUTURE)

        version     the UUID version number (1 through 8, meaningful only
                    when the variant is RFC_4122)

        is_safe     An enum indicating whether the UUID has been generated in
