"""Guess the MIME type of a file.

This module defines two useful functions:

guess_type(url, strict=True) -- guess the MIME type and encoding of a URL.

guess_extension(type, strict=True) -- guess the extension for a given MIME type.

It also contains the following, for tuning the behavior:

Data:

knownfiles -- list of files to parse
inited -- flag set when init() has been called
suffix_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes
encodings_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to encodings
types_map -- dictionary mapping suffixes to types

Functions:

init([files]) -- parse a list of files, default knownfiles (on Windows, the
  default values are taken from the registry)
read_mime_types(file) -- parse one file, return a dictionary or None
