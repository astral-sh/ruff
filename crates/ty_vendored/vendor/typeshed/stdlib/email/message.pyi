    A message object is defined as something that has a bunch of RFC 2822
    headers and a payload.  It may optionally have an envelope header
    (a.k.a. Unix-From or From_ header).  If the message is a container (i.e. a
    multipart or a message/rfc822), then the payload is a list of Message
    objects, otherwise it is a string.

    Message objects implement part of the 'mapping' interface, which assumes
    there is exactly one occurrence of the header per message.  Some headers
    do in fact appear multiple times (e.g. Received) and for those headers,
    you must use the explicit API to set or get all the headers.  Not all of
    the mapping methods are implemented.
