    Most of the classes and many of the methods in the email package accept
    Policy objects as parameters.  A Policy object contains a set of values and
    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.
    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC
    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'
    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.

    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing
    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,
    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by
    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can
