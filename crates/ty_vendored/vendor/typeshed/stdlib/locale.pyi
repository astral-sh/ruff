"""Locale support module.

The module provides low-level access to the C lib's locale APIs and adds high
level number formatting APIs as well as a locale aliasing engine to complement
these.

The aliasing engine includes support for many commonly used locale names and
maps them to values suitable for passing to the C lib's setlocale() function. It
also includes default encodings for all supported locale names.
