            This blocks while the queue is full.

            For most objects, the object received through Queue.get() will
            be a new one, equivalent to the original and not sharing any
            actual underlying data.  The notable exceptions include
            cross-interpreter types (like Queue) and memoryview, where the
            underlying data is actually shared.  Furthermore, some types
            can be sent through a queue more efficiently than others.  This
            group includes various immutable types like int, str, bytes, and
            tuple (if the items are likewise efficiently shareable).  See interpreters.is_shareable().

            "unbounditems" controls the behavior of Queue.get() for the given
            object if the current interpreter (calling put()) is later
            destroyed.

            If "unbounditems" is None (the default) then it uses the
            queue's default, set with create_queue(),
            which is usually UNBOUND.

            If "unbounditems" is UNBOUND_ERROR then get() will raise an
            ItemInterpreterDestroyed exception if the original interpreter
            has been destroyed.  This does not otherwise affect the queue;
            the next call to put() will work like normal, returning the next
            item in the queue.

            If "unbounditems" is UNBOUND_REMOVE then the item will be removed
            from the queue as soon as the original interpreter is destroyed.
            Be aware that this will introduce an imbalance between put()
            and get() calls.

            of the unbound item.
