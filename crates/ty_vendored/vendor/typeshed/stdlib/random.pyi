           triangular
           normal (Gaussian)
           lognormal
           negative exponential
           gamma
           beta

General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:

* The period is 2**19937-1.
* It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
* The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
  and is, therefore, threadsafe.
