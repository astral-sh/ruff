"""A generally useful event scheduler class.

Each instance of this class manages its own queue.
No multi-threading is implied; you are supposed to hack that
yourself, or use a single instance per application.

Each instance is parametrized with two functions, one that is
supposed to return the current time, one that is supposed to
implement a delay.  You can implement real-time scheduling by
substituting time and sleep from built-in module time, or you can
implement simulated time by writing your own functions.  This can
also be used to integrate scheduling with STDWIN events; the delay
function is allowed to modify the queue.  Time can be expressed as
integers or floating-point numbers, as long as it is consistent.

Events are specified by tuples (time, priority, action, argument, kwargs).
As in UNIX, lower priority numbers mean higher priority; in this
way the queue can be maintained as a priority queue.  Execution of the
event means calling the action function, passing it the argument
sequence in "argument" (remember that in Python, multiple function
arguments are be packed in a sequence) and keyword parameters in "kwargs".
The action function may be an instance method so it
has another way to reference private data (besides global variables).

        If blocking is False executes the scheduled events due to

        When there is a positive delay until the first event, the
        delay function is called and the event is left in the queue;
        otherwise, the event is removed from the queue and executed
        (its action function is called, passing it the argument).  If
        the delay function returns prematurely, it is simply
        restarted.

        It is legal for both the delay function and the action
        function to modify the queue or to raise an exception;
        exceptions are not caught but the scheduler's state remains
        well-defined so run() may be called again.

        A questionable hack is added to allow other threads to run:
        just after an event is executed, a delay of 0 is executed, to
        avoid monopolizing the CPU when other threads are also
        runnable.
