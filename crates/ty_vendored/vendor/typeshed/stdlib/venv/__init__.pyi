    """This class exists to allow virtual environment creation to be
customized. The constructor parameters determine the builder's
behaviour when called upon to create a virtual environment.

By default, the builder makes the system (global) site-packages dir
*un*available to the created environment.

If invoked using the Python -m option, the default is to use copying
on Windows platforms but symlinks elsewhere. If instantiated some
other way, the default is to *not* use symlinks.

                             dir is available to created environments.
:param clear: If True, delete the contents of the environment directory if
              it already exists, before environment creation.
:param symlinks: If True, attempt to symlink rather than copy files into
                 virtual environment.
:param upgrade: If True, upgrade an existing virtual environment.
:param with_pip: If True, ensure pip is installed in the virtual
                 environment
:param prompt: Alternative terminal prefix for the environment.

:param scm_ignore_files: Create ignore files for the SCMs specified by the
                         iterable.
