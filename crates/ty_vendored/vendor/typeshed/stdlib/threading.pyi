        the optional timeout occurs.

        When the timeout argument is present and not None, it should be a
        floating-point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds
        (or fractions thereof).

        This method returns the internal flag on exit, so it will always return
        True except if a timeout is given and the operation times out.
