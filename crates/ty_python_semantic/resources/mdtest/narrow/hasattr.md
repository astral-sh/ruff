# Narrowing using `hasattr()`

The builtin function `hasattr()` can be used to narrow nominal and structural types. This is
accomplished using an intersection with a synthesized protocol:

```py
from typing import final
from typing_extensions import LiteralString

class NonFinalClass: ...

def _(obj: NonFinalClass):
    if hasattr(obj, "spam"):
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: NonFinalClass & <Protocol with members 'spam'>
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: object
    else:
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: NonFinalClass & ~<Protocol with members 'spam'>

        # error: [unresolved-attribute]
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: Unknown

    if hasattr(obj, "not-an-identifier"):
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: NonFinalClass
    else:
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: NonFinalClass
```

For a final class, we recognize that there is no way that an object of `FinalClass` could ever have
a `spam` attribute, so the type is narrowed to `Never`:

```py
@final
class FinalClass: ...

def _(obj: FinalClass):
    if hasattr(obj, "spam"):
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: Never
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: Never
    else:
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: FinalClass

        # error: [unresolved-attribute]
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: Unknown
```

When the corresponding attribute is already defined on the class, `hasattr` narrowing does not
change the type. `<Protocol with members 'spam'>` is a supertype of `WithSpam`, and so
`WithSpam & <Protocol â€¦>` simplifies to `WithSpam`:

```py
class WithSpam:
    spam: int = 42

def _(obj: WithSpam):
    if hasattr(obj, "spam"):
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: WithSpam
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: int
    else:
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: Never
```

When a class may or may not have a `spam` attribute, `hasattr` narrowing can provide evidence that
the attribute exists. Here, no `possibly-unbound-attribute` error is emitted in the `if` branch:

```py
def returns_bool() -> bool:
    return False

class MaybeWithSpam:
    if returns_bool():
        spam: int = 42

def _(obj: MaybeWithSpam):
    # error: [possibly-unbound-attribute]
    reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: int

    if hasattr(obj, "spam"):
        reveal_type(obj)  #  revealed: MaybeWithSpam & <Protocol with members 'spam'>
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: int
    else:
        reveal_type(obj)  # revealed: MaybeWithSpam & ~<Protocol with members 'spam'>

        # TODO: Ideally, we would emit `[unresolved-attribute]` and reveal `Unknown` here:
        # error: [possibly-unbound-attribute]
        reveal_type(obj.spam)  # revealed: int
```
