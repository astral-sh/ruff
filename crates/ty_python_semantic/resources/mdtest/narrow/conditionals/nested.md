# Narrowing for nested conditionals

## Multiple negative contributions

```py
def _(x: int):
    if x != 1:
        if x != 2:
            if x != 3:
                reveal_type(x)  # revealed: int & ~Literal[1] & ~Literal[2] & ~Literal[3]
```

## Multiple negative contributions with simplification

```py
def _(flag1: bool, flag2: bool):
    x = 1 if flag1 else 2 if flag2 else 3

    if x != 1:
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[2, 3]
        if x != 2:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[3]
```

## elif-else blocks

```py
def _(flag1: bool, flag2: bool):
    x = 1 if flag1 else 2 if flag2 else 3

    if x != 1:
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[2, 3]
        if x == 2:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[2]
        elif x == 3:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[3]
        else:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Never

    elif x != 2:
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Literal[1]
    else:
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Never
```

## Comprehensions

```py
def _(xs: list[int | None], ys: list[str | bytes], list_of_optional_lists: list[list[int | None] | None]):
    [reveal_type(x) for x in xs if x is not None]  # revealed: int
    [reveal_type(y) for y in ys if isinstance(y, str)]  # revealed: str

    [_ for x in xs if x is not None if reveal_type(x) // 3 != 0]  # revealed: int

    [reveal_type(x) for x in xs if x is not None if x != 0 if x != 1]  # revealed: int & ~Literal[0] & ~Literal[1]

    [reveal_type((x, y)) for x in xs if x is not None for y in ys if isinstance(y, str)]  # revealed: tuple[int, str]
    [reveal_type((x, y)) for y in ys if isinstance(y, str) for x in xs if x is not None]  # revealed: tuple[int, str]

    [reveal_type(i) for inner in list_of_optional_lists if inner is not None for i in inner if i is not None]  # revealed: int
```

## Cross-scope narrowing

Narrowing constraints are also valid in eager nested scopes (however, because class variables are
not visible from nested scopes, constraints on those variables are invalid).

Currently they are assumed to be invalid in lazy nested scopes since there is a possibility that the
constraints may no longer be valid due to a "time lag". However, it may be possible to determine
that some of them are valid by performing a more detailed analysis (e.g. checking that the narrowing
target has not changed in all places where the function is called).

### Narrowing by attribute/subscript assignments

```py
class A:
    x: str | None = None

    def update_x(self, value: str | None):
        self.x = value

a = A()
a.x = "a"

class B:
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Literal["a"]

def f():
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Unknown | str | None

[reveal_type(a.x) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: Literal["a"]

a = A()

class C:
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: str | None

def g():
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Unknown | str | None

[reveal_type(a.x) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: str | None

a = A()
a.x = "a"
a.update_x("b")

class D:
    # TODO: should be `str | None`
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Literal["a"]

def h():
    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Unknown | str | None

# TODO: should be `str | None`
[reveal_type(a.x) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: Literal["a"]
```

### Narrowing by attribute/subscript assignments in nested scopes

```py
class D: ...

class C:
    d: D | None = None

class B:
    c1: C | None = None
    c2: C | None = None

class A:
    b: B | None = None

a = A()
a.b = B()

class _:
    a.b.c1 = C()

    class _:
        a.b.c1.d = D()
        a = 1

        class _3:
            reveal_type(a)  # revealed: A
            reveal_type(a.b.c1.d)  # revealed: D

    class _:
        a = 1
        # error: [unresolved-attribute]
        a.b.c1.d = D()

        class _3:
            reveal_type(a)  # revealed: A
            # TODO: should be `D | None`
            reveal_type(a.b.c1.d)  # revealed: Unknown

a.b.c1 = C()
a.b.c1.d = D()

class _:
    a.b = B()

    class _:
        # error: [possibly-unbound-attribute]
        reveal_type(a.b.c1.d)  # revealed: D | None
        reveal_type(a.b.c1)  # revealed: C | None
```

### Narrowing constraints introduced in eager nested scopes

```py
g: str | None = "a"

class A:
    x: str | None = None

a = A()

l: list[str | None] = [None]

def f(x: str | None):
    def _():
        if x is not None:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str

        if not isinstance(x, str):
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: None

        if g is not None:
            reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str

        if a.x is not None:
            reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: (Unknown & ~None) | str

        if l[0] is not None:
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str

    class C:
        if x is not None:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str

        if not isinstance(x, str):
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: None

        if g is not None:
            reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str

        if a.x is not None:
            reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: (Unknown & ~None) | str

        if l[0] is not None:
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str

    [reveal_type(x) for _ in range(1) if x is not None]  # revealed: str
```

### Narrowing constraints introduced in the outer scope

```py
g: str | None = "a"

class A:
    x: str | None = None

a = A()

l: list[str | None] = [None]

def f(x: str | None):
    if x is not None:
        def _():
            # If there is a possibility that `x` may be rewritten after this function definition,
            # the constraint `x is not None` outside the function is no longer be applicable for narrowing.
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str | None

        class C:
            reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str

        [reveal_type(x) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: str

    # When there is a reassignment, any narrowing constraints on the place are invalidated in lazy scopes.
    x = None

def f(x: str | None):
    def _():
        if x is not None:
            def closure():
                reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str | None
    x = None

def f(x: str | None):
    class C:
        def _():
            if x is not None:
                def closure():
                    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str
        x = None  # This assignment is not visible in the inner lazy scope, so narrowing is still valid.
```

If a variable defined in a private scope is never reassigned, narrowing remains in effect in the
inner lazy scope.

```py
def f(const: str | None):
    if const is not None:
        def _():
            # The `const is not None` narrowing constraint is still valid since `const` has not been reassigned
            reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str

        class C2:
            reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str

        [reveal_type(const) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: str

def f(const: str | None):
    def _():
        if const is not None:
            def closure():
                reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str
```

And even if there is an attribute or subscript assignment to the variable, narrowing of the variable
is still valid in the inner lazy scope.

```py
def f(l: list[str | None] | None):
    if l is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(l)  # revealed: list[str | None]
        l[0] = None

def f(a: A):
    if a:
        def _():
            reveal_type(a)  # revealed: A & ~AlwaysFalsy
    a.x = None
```

The opposite is not true, that is, if a root expression is reassigned, narrowing on the member are
no longer valid in the inner lazy scope.

```py
def f(l: list[str | None]):
    if l[0] is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str | None
        l = [None]

def f(l: list[str | None]):
    l[0] = "a"
    def _():
        reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str | None
    l = [None]

def f(l: list[str | None]):
    l[0] = "a"
    def _():
        l: list[str | None] = [None]
        def _():
            # TODO: should be `str | None`
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: Unknown

    def _():
        def _():
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str | None
        l: list[str | None] = [None]

def f(a: A):
    if a.x is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: str | None
    a = A()

def f(a: A):
    a.x = "a"
    def _():
        reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: str | None
    a = A()
```

Narrowing is also invalidated if a `nonlocal` declaration is made within a lazy scope.

```py
def f(non_local: str | None):
    if non_local is not None:
        def _():
            nonlocal non_local
            non_local = None

        def _():
            reveal_type(non_local)  # revealed: str | None

def f(non_local: str | None):
    def _():
        nonlocal non_local
        non_local = None
    if non_local is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(non_local)  # revealed: str | None
```

The same goes for public variables, attributes, and subscripts, because it is difficult to track all
of their changes.

```py
def f():
    if g is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str | None

        class D:
            reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str

        [reveal_type(g) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: str

    if a.x is not None:
        def _():
            # Lazy nested scope narrowing is not performed on attributes/subscripts because it's difficult to track their changes.
            reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: Unknown | str | None

        class D:
            reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: (Unknown & ~None) | str

        [reveal_type(a.x) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: (Unknown & ~None) | str

    if l[0] is not None:
        def _():
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str | None

        class D:
            reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str

        [reveal_type(l[0]) for _ in range(1)]  # revealed: str
```

### Narrowing constraints introduced in multiple scopes

```py
from typing import Literal

g: str | Literal[1] | None = "a"

class A:
    x: str | Literal[1] | None = None

a = A()

l: list[str | Literal[1] | None] = [None]

def f(x: str | Literal[1] | None):
    class C:
        # If we try to access a variable in a class before it has been defined,
        # the lookup will fall back to global.
        # error: [unresolved-reference]
        if x is not None:
            def _():
                if x != 1:
                    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str | None

            class D:
                if x != 1:
                    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: str

            [reveal_type(x) for _ in range(1) if x != 1]  # revealed: str

        x = None

    def _():
        # No narrowing is performed on unresolved references.
        # error: [unresolved-reference]
        if x is not None:
            def _():
                if x != 1:
                    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: None
        x = None

def f(const: str | Literal[1] | None):
    class C:
        if const is not None:
            def _():
                if const != 1:
                    reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str

            class D:
                if const != 1:
                    reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str

            [reveal_type(const) for _ in range(1) if const != 1]  # revealed: str

    def _():
        if const is not None:
            def _():
                if const != 1:
                    reveal_type(const)  # revealed: str

def f():
    class C:
        if g is not None:
            def _():
                if g != 1:
                    reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str | None

            class D:
                if g != 1:
                    reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str

        if a.x is not None:
            def _():
                if a.x != 1:
                    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: (Unknown & ~Literal[1]) | str | None

            class D:
                if a.x != 1:
                    reveal_type(a.x)  # revealed: (Unknown & ~Literal[1] & ~None) | str

        if l[0] is not None:
            def _():
                if l[0] != 1:
                    reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str | None

            class D:
                if l[0] != 1:
                    reveal_type(l[0])  # revealed: str
```

### Narrowing constraints with bindings in class scope, and nested scopes

```py
from typing import Literal

g: str | Literal[1] | None = "a"

def f(flag: bool):
    class C:
        (g := None) if flag else (g := None)
        # `g` is always bound here, so narrowing checks don't apply to nested scopes
        if g is not None:
            class F:
                reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str | Literal[1] | None

    class C:
        # this conditional binding leaves "unbound" visible, so following narrowing checks apply
        None if flag else (g := None)

        if g is not None:
            class F:
                reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str | Literal[1]

            # This class variable is not visible from the nested class scope.
            g = None

            # This additional constraint is not relevant to nested scopes, since it only applies to
            # a binding of `g` that they cannot see:
            if g is None:
                class E:
                    reveal_type(g)  # revealed: str | Literal[1]
```
