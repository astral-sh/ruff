//! Constraints under which type properties hold
//!
//! For "concrete" types (which contain no type variables), type properties like assignability have
//! simple answers: one type is either assignable to another type, or it isn't. (The _rules_ for
//! comparing two particular concrete types can be rather complex, but the _answer_ is a simple
//! "yes" or "no".)
//!
//! These properties are more complex when type variables are involved, because there are (usually)
//! many different concrete types that a typevar can be specialized to, and the type property might
//! hold for some specializations, but not for others. That means that for types that include
//! typevars, "Is this type assignable to another?" no longer makes sense as a question. The better
//! question is: "Under what constraints is this type assignable to another?".
//!
//! This module provides the machinery for representing the "under what constraints" part of that
//! question.
//!
//! An individual constraint restricts the specialization of a single typevar to be within a
//! particular lower and upper bound: the typevar can only specialize to a type that is a supertype
//! of the lower bound, and a subtype of the upper bound. (Note that lower and upper bounds are
//! fully static; we take the bottom and top materializations of the bounds to remove any gradual
//! forms if needed.) Either bound can be "closed" (where the bound is a valid specialization), or
//! "open" (where it is not).
//!
//! You can then build up more complex constraint sets using union, intersection, and negation
//! operations. We use a disjunctive normal form (DNF) representation, just like we do for types: a
//! [constraint set][ConstraintSet] is the union of zero or more [clauses][ConstraintClause], each
//! of which is the intersection of zero or more [individual constraints][AtomicConstraint]. Note
//! that the constraint set that contains no clauses is never satisfiable (`⋃ {} = 0`); and the
//! constraint set that contains a single clause, where that clause contains no constraints,
//! is always satisfiable (`⋃ {⋂ {}} = 1`).
//!
//! NOTE: This module is currently in a transitional state: we've added a [`Constraints`] trait,
//! and updated all of our type property implementations to work on any impl of that trait. We have
//! added the DNF [`ConstraintSet`] representation, and updated all of our property checks to build
//! up a constraint set and then check whether it is ever or always satisfiable, as appropriate. We
//! are not yet inferring specializations from those constraints, and we will likely remove the
//! [`Constraints`] trait once everything has stabilized.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! For instance, in the following Python code:
//!
//! ```py
//! class A: ...
//! class B(A): ...
//!
//! def _[T: B](t: T) -> None: ...
//! def _[U: (int, str)](u: U) -> None: ...
//! ```
//!
//! The typevar `T` has an upper bound of `B`, which would translate into the constraint
//! `Never ≤ T ≤ B`. (Every type is a supertype of `Never`, so having `Never` as a closed lower
//! bound means that there is effectively no lower bound. Similarly, a closed upper bound of
//! `object` means that there is effectively no upper bound.) The `T ≤ B` part expresses that the
//! type can specialize to any type that is a subtype of B. The bound is "closed", which means that
//! this includes `B` itself.
//!
//! The typevar `U` is constrained to be either `int` or `str`, which would translate into the
//! constraint `(int ≤ T ≤ int) ∪ (str ≤ T ≤ str)`. When the lower and upper bounds are the same
//! (and both closed), the constraint says that the typevar must specialize to that _exact_ type,
//! not to a subtype or supertype of it.
//!
//! Python does not give us an easy way to construct this, but we can also consider a typevar that
//! can specialize to any type that `T` _cannot_ specialize to — that is, the negation of `T`'s
//! constraint. Another way to write `Never ≤ V ≤ B` is `Never ≤ V ∩ V ≤ B`; if we negate that, we
//! get `¬(Never ≤ V) ∪ ¬(V ≤ B)`, or `V < Never ∪ B < V`. Note that the bounds in this constraint
//! are now open! `B < V` indicates that `V` can specialize to any type that is a supertype of `B`
//! — but not to `B` itself. (For instance, it _can_ specialize to `A`.) `V < Never` is also open,
//! and says that `V` can specialize to any type that is a subtype of `Never`, but not to `Never`
//! itself. There aren't any types that satisfy that constraint (the type would have to somehow
//! contain a negative number of values). You can think of a constraint that cannot be satisfied as
//! an empty set (of types), which means we can simplify it out of the union. That gives us a final
//! constraint of `B < V` for the negation of `T`'s constraint.

/// In our documentation, we will show constraints using a few different notations:
///
/// - "Interval" notation: `[s, t]`, `(s, t)`, `[s, t)`, or `(s, t]`, where a square bracket
///   indicates that bound is closed, and a parenthesis indicates that it is open.
///
/// - ASCII art: `s┠──┨t`, `s╟──╢t`, `s┠──╢t`, or `s╟──┨t`, where a solid bar indicates a closed
///   bound, and a double bar indicates an open bound.
///
/// - "Comparison" notation: `s ≤ T ≤ t`, `s < T < t`, `s ≤ T < t`, or `s < T ≤ T`, where `≤`

/// - The bounds must actually constrain the typevar. If the typevar can be specialized to any
