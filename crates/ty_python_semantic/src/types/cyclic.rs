//! Cycle detection for recursive types.
//!
//! The visitors here (`TypeTransformer` and `PairVisitor`) are used in methods that recursively
//! visit types to transform them (e.g. `Type::normalize`) or to decide a relation between a pair
//! of types (e.g. `Type::has_relation_to`).
//!
//! The typical pattern is that the "entry" method (e.g. `Type::has_relation_to`) will create a
//! visitor and pass it to the recursive method (e.g. `Type::has_relation_to_impl`). Rust types
//! that form part of a complex type (e.g. tuples, protocols, nominal instances, etc) should
//! usually just implement the recursive method, and all recursive calls should call the recursive
//! method and pass along the visitor.
//!
//! Not all recursive calls need to actually call `.visit` on the visitor; only when visiting types
//! that can create a recursive relationship (this includes, for example, type aliases and
//! protocols).
//!
//! There is a risk of double-visiting, for example if `Type::has_relation_to_impl` calls
//! `visitor.visit` when visiting a protocol type, and then internal `has_relation_to_impl` methods
//! of the Rust types implementing protocols also call `visitor.visit`. The best way to avoid this
//! is to prefer always calling `visitor.visit` only in the main recursive method on `Type`.
