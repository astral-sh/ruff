//! Track live bindings per place, applicable constraints per binding, and live declarations.
//!
//! These data structures operate entirely on scope-local newtype-indices for definitions and
//! constraints, referring to their location in the `all_definitions` and `all_constraints`
//! indexvecs in [`super::UseDefMapBuilder`].
//!
//! We need to track arbitrary associations between bindings and constraints, not just a single set
//! of currently dominating constraints (where "dominating" means "control flow must have passed
//! through it to reach this point"), because we can have dominating constraints that apply to some
//! bindings but not others, as in this code:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1 if flag else None
//! if x is not None:
//!     if flag2:
//!         x = 2 if flag else None
//!     x
//! ```
//!
//! The `x is not None` constraint dominates the final use of `x`, but it applies only to the first
//! binding of `x`, not the second, so `None` is a possible value for `x`.
//!
//! And we can't just track, for each binding, an index into a list of dominating constraints,
//! either, because we can have bindings which are still visible, but subject to constraints that
//! are no longer dominating, as in this code:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 0
//! if flag1:
//!     x = 1 if flag2 else None
//!     assert x is not None
//! x
//! ```
//!
//! From the point of view of the final use of `x`, the `x is not None` constraint no longer
//! dominates, but it does dominate the `x = 1 if flag2 else None` binding, so we have to keep
//! track of that.
//!
//! The data structures use `IndexVec` arenas to store all data compactly and contiguously, while
//! supporting very cheap clones.
//!
//! Tracking live declarations is simpler, since constraints are not involved, but otherwise very
//! similar to tracking live bindings.
