//! First, some terminology:
//!
//! * A "place" is semantically a location where a value can be read or written, and syntactically,
//!   an expression that can be the target of an assignment, e.g. `x`, `x[0]`, `x.y`. (The term is
//!   borrowed from Rust). In Python syntax, an expression like `f().x` is also allowed as the
//!   target so it can be called a place, but we do not record declarations / bindings like `f().x:
//!   int`, `f().x = ...`. Type checking itself can be done by recording only assignments to names,
//!   but in order to perform type narrowing by attribute/subscript assignments, they must also be
//!   recorded.
//!
//! * A "binding" gives a new value to a place. This includes many different Python statements
//!   (assignment statements of course, but also imports, `def` and `class` statements, `as`
//!   clauses in `with` and `except` statements, match patterns, and others) and even one
//!   expression kind (named expressions). It notably does not include annotated assignment
//!   statements without a right-hand side value; these do not assign any new value to the place.
//!   We consider function parameters to be bindings as well, since (from the perspective of the
//!   function's internal scope), a function parameter begins the scope bound to a value.
//!
//! * A "declaration" establishes an upper bound type for the values that a variable may be
//!   permitted to take on. Annotated assignment statements (with or without an RHS value) are
//!   declarations; annotated function parameters are also declarations. We consider `def` and
//!   `class` statements to also be declarations, so as to prohibit accidentally shadowing them.
//!
//! Annotated assignments with a right-hand side, and annotated function parameters, are both
//! bindings and declarations.
//!
//! We use [`Definition`] as the universal term (and Salsa tracked struct) encompassing both
//! bindings and declarations. (This sacrifices a bit of type safety in exchange for improved
//! performance via fewer Salsa tracked structs and queries, since most declarations -- typed
//! parameters and annotated assignments with RHS -- are both bindings and declarations.)
//!
//! At any given use of a variable, we can ask about both its "declared type" and its "inferred
//! type". These may be different, but the inferred type must always be assignable to the declared
//! type; that is, the declared type is always wider, and the inferred type may be more precise. If
//! we see an invalid assignment, we emit a diagnostic and abandon our inferred type, deferring to
//! the declared type (this allows an explicit annotation to override bad inference, without a
//! cast), maintaining the invariant.
//!
//! The **inferred type** represents the most precise type we believe encompasses all possible
//! values for the variable at a given use. It is based on a union of the bindings which can reach
//! that use through some control flow path, and the narrowing constraints that control flow must
//! have passed through between the binding and the use. For example, in this code:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1 if flag else None
//! if x is not None:
//!     use(x)
//! ```
//!
//! For the use of `x` on the third line, the inferred type should be `Literal[1]`. This is based
//! on the binding on the first line, which assigns the type `Literal[1] | None`, and the narrowing
//! constraint on the second line, which rules out the type `None`, since control flow must pass
//! through this constraint to reach the use in question.
//!
//! The **declared type** represents the code author's declaration (usually through a type
//! annotation) that a given variable should not be assigned any type outside the declared type. In
//! our model, declared types are also control-flow-sensitive; we allow the code author to
//! explicitly redeclare the same variable with a different type. So for a given binding of a
//! variable, we will want to ask which declarations of that variable can reach that binding, in
//! order to determine whether the binding is permitted, or should be a type error. For example:
//!
//! ```python
//! from pathlib import Path
//! def f(path: str):
//!     path: Path = Path(path)
//! ```
//!
//! In this function, the initial declared type of `path` is `str`, meaning that the assignment
//! `path = Path(path)` would be a type error, since it assigns to `path` a value whose type is not
//! assignable to `str`. This is the purpose of declared types: they prevent accidental assignment
//! of the wrong type to a variable.
//!
//! But in some cases it is useful to "shadow" or "redeclare" a variable with a new type, and we
//! permit this, as long as it is done with an explicit re-annotation. So `path: Path =
//! Path(path)`, with the explicit `: Path` annotation, is permitted.
//!
//! The general rule is that whatever declaration(s) can reach a given binding determine the
//! validity of that binding. If there is a path in which the place is not declared, that is a
//! declaration of `Unknown`. If multiple declarations can reach a binding, we union them, but by
//! default we also issue a type error, since this implicit union of declared types may hide an
//! error.
//!
//! To support type inference, we build a map from each use of a place to the bindings live at
//! that use, and the type narrowing constraints that apply to each binding.
//!
//! Let's take this code sample:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1
//! x = 2
//! y = x
//! if flag:
//!     x = 3
//! else:
//!     x = 4
//! z = x
//! ```
//!
//! In this snippet, we have four bindings of `x` (the statements assigning `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`
//! to it), and two uses of `x` (the `y = x` and `z = x` assignments). The first binding of `x`
//! does not reach any use, because it's immediately replaced by the second binding, before any use
//! happens. (A linter could thus flag the statement `x = 1` as likely superfluous.)
//!
//! The first use of `x` has one live binding: the assignment `x = 2`.
//!
//! Things get a bit more complex when we have branches. We will definitely take either the `if` or
//! the `else` branch. Thus, the second use of `x` has two live bindings: `x = 3` and `x = 4`. The
//! `x = 2` assignment is no longer visible, because it must be replaced by either `x = 3` or `x =
//! 4`, no matter which branch was taken. We don't know which branch was taken, so we must consider
//! both bindings as live, which means eventually we would (in type inference) look at these two
//! bindings and infer a type of `Literal[3, 4]` -- the union of `Literal[3]` and `Literal[4]` --
//! for the second use of `x`.
//!
//! So that's one question our use-def map needs to answer: given a specific use of a place, which
//! binding(s) can reach that use. In [`AstIds`](crate::semantic_index::ast_ids::AstIds) we number
//! all uses (that means a `Name`/`ExprAttribute`/`ExprSubscript` node with `Load` context)
//! so we have a `ScopedUseId` to efficiently represent each use.
//!
//! We also need to know, for a given definition of a place, what type narrowing constraints apply
//! to it. For instance, in this code sample:
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1 if flag else None
//! if x is not None:
//!     use(x)
//! ```
//!
//! At the use of `x`, the live binding of `x` is `1 if flag else None`, which would infer as the
//! type `Literal[1] | None`. But the constraint `x is not None` dominates this use, which means we
//! can rule out the possibility that `x` is `None` here, which should give us the type
//! `Literal[1]` for this use.
//!
//! For declared types, we need to be able to answer the question "given a binding to a place,
//! which declarations of that place can reach the binding?" This allows us to emit a diagnostic
//! if the binding is attempting to bind a value of a type that is not assignable to the declared
//! type for that place, at that point in control flow.
//!
//! We also need to know, given a declaration of a place, what the inferred type of that place is
//! at that point. This allows us to emit a diagnostic in a case like `x = "foo"; x: int`. The
//! binding `x = "foo"` occurs before the declaration `x: int`, so according to our
//! control-flow-sensitive interpretation of declarations, the assignment is not an error. But the
//! declaration is an error, since it would violate the "inferred type must be assignable to
//! declared type" rule.
//!
//! Another case we need to handle is when a place is referenced from a different scope (for
//! example, an import or a nonlocal reference). We call this "public" use of a place. For public
//! use of a place, we prefer the declared type, if there are any declarations of that place; if
//! not, we fall back to the inferred type. So we also need to know which declarations and bindings
//! can reach the end of the scope.
//!
//! Technically, public use of a place could occur from any point in control flow of the scope
//! where the place is defined (via inline imports and import cycles, in the case of an import, or
//! via a function call partway through the local scope that ends up using a place from the scope
//! via a global or nonlocal reference.) But modeling this fully accurately requires whole-program
//! analysis that isn't tractable for an efficient analysis, since it means a given place could
//! have a different type every place it's referenced throughout the program, depending on the
//! shape of arbitrarily-sized call/import graphs. So we follow other Python type checkers in
//! making the simplifying assumption that usually the scope will finish execution before its
//! places are made visible to other scopes; for instance, most imports will import from a
//! complete module, not a partially-executed module. (We may want to get a little smarter than
//! this in the future for some closures, but for now this is where we start.)
//!
//! The data structure we build to answer these questions is the `UseDefMap`. It has a
//! `bindings_by_use` vector of [`Bindings`] indexed by [`ScopedUseId`], a
//! `declarations_by_binding` vector of [`Declarations`] indexed by [`ScopedDefinitionId`], a
//! `bindings_by_declaration` vector of [`Bindings`] indexed by [`ScopedDefinitionId`], and
//! `public_bindings` and `public_definitions` vectors indexed by [`ScopedPlaceId`]. The values in
//! each of these vectors are (in principle) a list of live bindings at that use/definition, or at
//! the end of the scope for that place, with a list of the dominating constraints for each
//! binding.
//!
//! In order to avoid vectors-of-vectors-of-vectors and all the allocations that would entail, we
//! don't actually store these "list of visible definitions" as a vector of [`Definition`].
//! Instead, [`Bindings`] and [`Declarations`] are structs which use bit-sets to track
//! definitions (and constraints, in the case of bindings) in terms of [`ScopedDefinitionId`] and
//! [`ScopedPredicateId`], which are indices into the `all_definitions` and `predicates`
//! indexvecs in the [`UseDefMap`].
//!
//! There is another special kind of possible "definition" for a place: there might be a path from
//! the scope entry to a given use in which the place is never bound. We model this with a special
//! "unbound/undeclared" definition (a [`DefinitionState::Undefined`] entry at the start of the
//! `all_definitions` vector). If that sentinel definition is present in the live bindings at a
//! given use, it means that there is a possible path through control flow in which that place is
//! unbound. Similarly, if that sentinel is present in the live declarations, it means that the
//! place is (possibly) undeclared.
//!
//! To build a [`UseDefMap`], the [`UseDefMapBuilder`] is notified of each new use, definition, and
//! constraint as they are encountered by the
//! [`SemanticIndexBuilder`](crate::semantic_index::builder::SemanticIndexBuilder) AST visit. For
//! each place, the builder tracks the `PlaceState` (`Bindings` and `Declarations`) for that place.
//! When we hit a use or definition of a place, we record the necessary parts of the current state
//! for that place that we need for that use or definition. When we reach the end of the scope, it
//! records the state for each place as the public definitions of that place.
//!
//! ```python
//! x = 1
//! x = 2
//! y = x
//! if flag:
//!     x = 3
//! else:
//!     x = 4
//! z = x
//! ```
//!
//! Let's walk through the above example. Initially we do not have any record of `x`. When we add
//! the new place (before we process the first binding), we create a new undefined `PlaceState`
//! which has a single live binding (the "unbound" definition) and a single live declaration (the
//! "undeclared" definition). When we see `x = 1`, we record that as the sole live binding of `x`.
//! The "unbound" binding is no longer visible. Then we see `x = 2`, and we replace `x = 1` as the
//! sole live binding of `x`. When we get to `y = x`, we record that the live bindings for that use
//! of `x` are just the `x = 2` definition.
//!
//! Then we hit the `if` branch. We visit the `test` node (`flag` in this case), since that will
//! happen regardless. Then we take a pre-branch snapshot of the current state for all places,
//! which we'll need later. Then we record `flag` as a possible constraint on the current binding
//! (`x = 2`), and go ahead and visit the `if` body. When we see `x = 3`, it replaces `x = 2`
//! (constrained by `flag`) as the sole live binding of `x`. At the end of the `if` body, we take
//! another snapshot of the current place state; we'll call this the post-if-body snapshot.
//!
//! Now we need to visit the `else` clause. The conditions when entering the `else` clause should
//! be the pre-if conditions; if we are entering the `else` clause, we know that the `if` test
//! failed and we didn't execute the `if` body. So we first reset the builder to the pre-if state,
//! using the snapshot we took previously (meaning we now have `x = 2` as the sole binding for `x`
//! again), and record a *negative* `flag` constraint for all live bindings (`x = 2`). We then
//! visit the `else` clause, where `x = 4` replaces `x = 2` as the sole live binding of `x`.
//!
//! Now we reach the end of the if/else, and want to visit the following code. The state here needs
//! to reflect that we might have gone through the `if` branch, or we might have gone through the
//! `else` branch, and we don't know which. So we need to "merge" our current builder state
//! (reflecting the end-of-else state, with `x = 4` as the only live binding) with our post-if-body
//! snapshot (which has `x = 3` as the only live binding). The result of this merge is that we now
//! have two live bindings of `x`: `x = 3` and `x = 4`.
//!
//! Another piece of information that the `UseDefMap` needs to provide are reachability constraints.
//! See [`reachability_constraints.rs`] for more details, in particular how they apply to bindings.
//!
//! The [`UseDefMapBuilder`] itself just exposes methods for taking a snapshot, resetting to a
//! snapshot, and merging a snapshot into the current state. The logic using these methods lives in
//! [`SemanticIndexBuilder`](crate::semantic_index::builder::SemanticIndexBuilder), e.g. where it
//! visits a `StmtIf` node.
