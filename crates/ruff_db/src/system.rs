/// The system on which Ruff runs.
///
/// Ruff supports running on the CLI, in a language server, and in a browser (WASM). Each of these
/// host-systems differ in what system operations they support and how they interact with the file system:
/// * Language server:
///    * Reading a file's content should take into account that it might have unsaved changes because it's open in the editor.
///    * Use structured representations for notebooks, making deserializing a notebook from a string unnecessary.
///    * Use their own file watching infrastructure.
/// * WASM (Browser):
///    * There are ways to emulate a file system in WASM but a native memory-filesystem is more efficient.
///    * Doesn't support a current working directory
///    * File watching isn't supported.
///
/// Abstracting the system also enables tests to use a more efficient in-memory file system.
