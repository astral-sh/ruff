## Input
```py
(a for b in c)

# parens around generator expression not required
len(a for b in c)

# parens around generator expression required
sum((a for b in c), start=0)

# black keeps these atm, but intends to remove them in the future:
# https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2943
f((1 for _ in a))

# make sure source parenthesis detection isn't fooled by these
f((1) for _ in (a))

# combination of the two above
f(((1) for _ in (a)))

bases = tuple(
     (base._meta.label_lower if hasattr(base, "_meta") else base)
     for base in flattened_bases
)
