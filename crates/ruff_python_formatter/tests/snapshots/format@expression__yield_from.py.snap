## Input
```python

def foo():
    yield from l # some comment

    # weird indents
    yield\

                        l
                    # indented trailing comment

    with (
        # Comment
        yield from l
        # Comment
    ):
        pass

    c = [(yield from l) , (
        yield from l

    )]

    while (
        yield from l
    ):
        pass

    yield (
        yield from l

## Output
```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        # Comment
    ):
        pass

    c = [(yield from l), (yield from l)]

    while (yield from l):
