## Input

```python
try:
    ...
# These parens can be removed on 3.14+ but not earlier
except (BaseException, Exception, ValueError):
    ...

try:
    ...
# They can also be omitted for `except*`
except* (BaseException, Exception, ValueError):
    ...

# But parentheses are still required in the presence of an `as` binding
try:
    ...
# These parens can be removed on 3.14+ but not earlier
except (BaseException, Exception, ValueError) as e:
    ...

try:
    ...
# They can also be omitted for `except*`
except* (BaseException, Exception, ValueError) as e:
    ...
```
