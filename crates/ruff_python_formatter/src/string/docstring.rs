/// Format a docstring by trimming whitespace and adjusting the indentation.
///
/// Summary of changes we make:
/// * Normalize the string like all other strings
/// * Ignore docstring that have an escaped newline
/// * Trim all trailing whitespace, except for a chaperone space that avoids quotes or backslashes
///   in the last line.
/// * Trim leading whitespace on the first line, again except for a chaperone space
/// * If there is only content in the first line and after that only whitespace, collapse the
///   docstring into one line
/// * Adjust the indentation (see below)
///
/// # Docstring indentation
///
/// Unlike any other string, like black we change the indentation of docstring lines.
///
/// We want to preserve the indentation inside the docstring relative to the suite statement/block
/// indent that the docstring statement is in, but also want to apply the change of the outer
/// indentation in the docstring, e.g.
/// ```python
/// def sparkle_sky():
///   """Make a pretty sparkly sky.
///   *       * ✨        *.    .
///      *       *      ✨      .
///      .  *      . ✨    * .  .
///   """
/// ```
/// should become
/// ```python
/// def sparkle_sky():
///     """Make a pretty sparkly sky.
///     *       * ✨        *.    .
///        *       *      ✨      .
///        .  *      . ✨    * .  .
///     """
/// ```
/// We can't compute the full indentation here since we don't know what the block indent of
/// the doc comment will be yet and which we can only have added by formatting each line
/// separately with a hard line break. This means we need to strip shared indentation from
/// docstring while preserving the in-docstring bigger-than-suite-statement indentation. Example:
/// ```python
/// def f():
///  """first line
///  line a
///     line b
///  """
/// ```
/// The docstring indentation is 2, the block indents will change this to 4 (but we can't
/// determine this at this point). The indentation of line a is 2, so we trim `  line a`
/// to `line a`. For line b it's 5, so we trim it to `line b` and pad with 5-2=3 spaces to
/// `   line b`. The closing quotes, being on their own line, are stripped get only the
/// default indentation. Fully formatted:
/// ```python
/// def f():
///    """first line
///    line a
///       line b
///    """
/// ```
///
/// Tabs are counted by padding them to the next multiple of 8 according to
/// [`str.expandtabs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.expandtabs). When
/// we see indentation that contains a tab or any other none ascii-space whitespace we rewrite the
/// string.
///
/// Additionally, if any line in the docstring has less indentation than the docstring
/// (effectively a negative indentation wrt. to the current level), we pad all lines to the
/// level of the docstring with spaces.
/// ```python
/// def f():
///    """first line
/// line a
///    line b
///      line c
///    """
/// ```
/// Here line a is 3 columns negatively indented, so we pad all lines by an extra 3 spaces:
/// ```python
/// def f():
///    """first line
///    line a
///       line b
///         line c
///    """
/// ```
