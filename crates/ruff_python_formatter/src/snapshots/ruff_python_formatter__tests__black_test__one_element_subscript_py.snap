## Input

```py
# We should not treat the trailing comma
# in a single-element subscript.
a: tuple[int,]
b = tuple[int,]

# The magic comma still applies to multi-element subscripts.
c: tuple[int, int,]
d = tuple[int, int,]

# Magic commas still work as expected for non-subscripts.
small_list = [1,]
list_of_types = [tuple[int,],]
```
