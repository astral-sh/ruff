// a background task is built using an outer closure that borrows the session to take a snapshot,
// that the inner closure can capture. This builder closure has a lifetime linked to the scheduler.
// When the task is dispatched, the scheduler runs the synchronous builder, which takes the session
// as a reference, to create the inner 'static closure. That closure is then moved to a background task pool.
