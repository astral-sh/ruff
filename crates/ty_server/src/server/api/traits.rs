//! Traits for handling requests and notifications from the LSP client.
//!
//! This module defines the trait abstractions used by the language server to handle incoming
//! requests and notifications from clients. It provides a type-safe way to implement LSP handlers
//! with different execution models (synchronous or asynchronous) and automatic retry capabilities.
//!
//! All request and notification handlers must implement the base traits [`RequestHandler`] and
//! [`NotificationHandler`], respectively, which associate them with specific LSP request or
//! notification types. These base traits are then extended by more specific traits that define
//! the execution model of the handler.
//!
//! The [`SyncRequestHandler`] and [`SyncNotificationHandler`] traits are for handlers that
//! executes synchronously on the main loop, providing mutable access to the [`Session`] that
//! contains the current state of the server. This is useful for handlers that need to modify
//! the server state such as when the content of a file changes.
//!
//! The [`BackgroundDocumentRequestHandler`] and [`BackgroundDocumentNotificationHandler`] traits
//! are for handlers that operate on a single document and can be executed on a background thread.
//! These handlers will have access to a snapshot of the document at the time of the request or
//! notification, allowing them to perform operations without blocking the main loop. There is also
//! the [`BackgroundRequestHandler`] trait for handlers that operate on the entire session, which
//! includes all the workspaces, instead of a single document and can also be executed on a
//! background thread like fetching the workspace diagnostics.
//!
//! The [`RetriableRequestHandler`] trait is a marker trait for handlers that can be retried if the
//! Salsa database is modified during execution.
//!
//! The [`SyncNotificationHandler`] is the most common trait that would be used because most
//! notifications are specific to a single document and require updating the server state.
//! Similarly, the [`BackgroundDocumentRequestHandler`] is the most common request handler that
//! would be used as most requests are document-specific and can be executed in the background.
//!
//! See the `./requests` and `./notifications` directories for concrete implementations of these
//! traits in action.
