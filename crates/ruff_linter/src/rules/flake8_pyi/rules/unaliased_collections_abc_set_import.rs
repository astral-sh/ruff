/// ## What it does
/// Checks for `from collections.abc import Set` imports that do not alias
/// `Set` to `AbstractSet`.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// The `Set` type in `collections.abc` is an abstract base class for set-like types.
/// It is easily confused with, and not equivalent to, the `set` builtin.
///
/// To avoid confusion, `Set` should be aliased to `AbstractSet` when imported. This
/// makes it clear that the imported type is an abstract base class, and not the
/// `set` builtin.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// from collections.abc import Set
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// from collections.abc import Set as AbstractSet
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for `Set` imports defined at the
/// top-level of a `.py` module. Top-level symbols are implicitly exported by the
/// module, and so renaming a top-level symbol may break downstream modules
/// that import it.
///
/// The same is not true for `.pyi` files, where imported symbols are only
/// re-exported if they are included in `__all__`, use a "redundant"
/// `import foo as foo` alias, or are imported via a `*` import. As such, the
/// fix is marked as safe in more cases for `.pyi` files.
