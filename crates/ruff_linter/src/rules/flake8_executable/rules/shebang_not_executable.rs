/// ## What it does
/// Checks for a shebang directive in a file that is not executable.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
/// script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
/// script.
///
/// The presence of a shebang suggests that a file is intended to be
/// executable. If a file contains a shebang but is not executable, then the
/// shebang is misleading, or the file is missing the executable bit.
///
/// If the file is meant to be executable, add the executable bit to the file
/// (e.g., `chmod +x __main__.py` or `git update-index --chmod=+x __main__.py`).
///
/// Otherwise, remove the shebang.
///
/// ## Filesystem considerations
///
/// A file is considered executable if it has the executable bit set (i.e., its
/// permissions mode intersects with `0o111`). As such, _this rule is only
/// available on Unix-like filesystems_.
///
/// It is not enforced on Windows, and will never trigger on Unix-like systems
/// if the _project root_ is located on a _filesystem which does not support
/// Unix-like permissions_ (e.g. mounting an removable drive using FAT or using
/// /mnt/c/ on WSL).
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// #!/usr/bin/env python
/// ```
