/// ## What it does
/// Checks for executable `.py` files that do not have a shebang.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
/// script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
/// script.
///
/// If a `.py` file is executable, but does not have a shebang, it may be run
/// with the wrong interpreter, or fail to run at all.
///
/// If the file is meant to be executable, add a shebang, as in:
/// ```python
/// #!/usr/bin/env python
/// ```
///
/// Otherwise, remove the executable bit from the file
/// (e.g., `chmod -x __main__.py` or `git update-index --chmod=-x __main__.py`).
///
/// ## Filesystem considerations
///
/// A file is considered executable if it has the executable bit set (i.e., its
/// permissions mode intersects with `0o111`). As such, _this rule is only
/// available on Unix-like filesystems_.
///
/// It is not enforced on Windows, nor on Unix-like systems if the _project root_
/// is located on a _filesystem which does not support Unix-like permissions_
/// (e.g. mounting an removable drive using FAT or using /mnt/c/ on WSL).
