/// ## What it does
/// Checks for uses of except handling via `try`-`except` within `for` and
/// `while` loops.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Exception handling via `try`-`except` blocks incurs some performance
/// overhead, regardless of whether an exception is raised.
///
/// To optimize your code, two techniques are possible:
/// 1. Refactor your code to put the entire loop into the `try`-`except` block,
///    rather than wrapping each iteration in a separate `try`-`except` block.
/// 2. Use "Look Before You Leap" idioms that attempt to avoid exceptions
///    being raised in the first place, avoiding the need to use `try`-`except`
///    blocks in the first place.
///
/// This rule is only enforced for Python versions prior to 3.11, which
/// introduced "zero-cost" exception handling. However, note that even on
/// Python 3.11 and newer, refactoring your code to avoid exception handling in
/// tight loops can provide a significant speedup in some cases, as zero-cost
/// exception handling is only zero-cost in the "happy path" where no exception
/// is raised in the `try`-`except` block.
///
/// As with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
/// micro-optimization. In many cases, it will have a negligible impact on
/// performance.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// string_numbers: list[str] = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "5"]
///
/// # `try`/`except` that could be moved out of the loop:
/// int_numbers: list[int] = []
/// for num in string_numbers:
///     try:
///         int_numbers.append(int(num))
///     except ValueError as e:
///         print(f"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}")
///         break
///
/// # `try`/`except` used when "look before you leap" idioms could be used:
/// number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: "one", 3: "three", 4: "four"}
/// for number in range(5):
///     try:
///         name = number_names[number]
///     except KeyError:
///         continue
///     else:
///         print(f"The name of {number} is {name}")
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// string_numbers: list[str] = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "5"]
///
/// int_numbers: list[int] = []
/// try:
///     for num in string_numbers:
///         int_numbers.append(int(num))
/// except ValueError as e:
///     print(f"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}")
///
/// number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: "one", 3: "three", 4: "four"}
/// for number in range(5):
///     name = number_names.get(number)
///     if name is not None:
///         print(f"The name of {number} is {name}")
/// ```
