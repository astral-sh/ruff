/// ## What it does
/// Checks for functions that include too many local variables.
///
/// By default, this rule allows up to fifteen locals, as configured by the
/// [`pylint.max-locals`] option.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Functions with many local variables are harder to understand and maintain.
///
/// Consider refactoring functions with many local variables into smaller
/// functions with fewer assignments.
///
/// ## Options
/// - `pylint.max-locals`
