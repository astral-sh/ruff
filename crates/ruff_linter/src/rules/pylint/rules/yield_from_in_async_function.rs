/// ## What it does
/// Checks for uses of `yield from` in async functions.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Python doesn't support the use of `yield from` in async functions, and will
/// raise a `SyntaxError` in such cases.
///
/// Instead, considering refactoring the code to use an `async for` loop instead.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// async def numbers():
///     yield from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// async def numbers():
///     async for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
///         yield number
/// ```
