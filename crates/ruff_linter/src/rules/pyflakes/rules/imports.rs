/// ## What it does
/// Checks for import bindings that are shadowed by loop variables.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Shadowing an import with loop variables makes the code harder to read and
/// reason about, as the identify of the imported binding is no longer clear.
/// It's also often indicative of a mistake, as it's unlikely that the loop
/// variable is intended to be used as the imported binding.
///
/// Consider using a different name for the loop variable.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// from os import path
///
/// for path in files:
///     print(path)
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// from os import path
///
///
/// for filename in files:
///     print(filename)
/// ```

/// If the name _is_ defined in via a wildcard import, that member should be
