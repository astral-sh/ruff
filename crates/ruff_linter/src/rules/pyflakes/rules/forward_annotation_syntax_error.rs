/// ## What it does
/// Checks for forward annotations that include invalid syntax.
///
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, type annotations can be quoted as strings literals to enable
/// references to types that have not yet been defined, known as "forward
/// references".
///
/// However, these quoted annotations must be valid Python expressions. The use
/// of invalid syntax in a quoted annotation won't raise a `SyntaxError`, but
/// will instead raise an error when type checking is performed.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```python
/// def foo() -> "/": ...
/// ```
///
/// ## References
/// - [PEP 563 â€“ Postponed Evaluation of Annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/)
