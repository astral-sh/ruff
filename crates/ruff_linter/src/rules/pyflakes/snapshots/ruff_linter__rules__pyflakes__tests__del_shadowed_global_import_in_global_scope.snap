<filename>:5:12: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
  |
4 | def f():
5 |     import os
  |            ^^ F401
6 | 
7 | # Despite this `del`, `import os` in `f` should still be flagged as shadowing an unused

  = help: Remove unused import: `os`

â„¹ Safe fix
2 2 | import os
3 3 | 
4 4 | def f():
5   |-    import os
  5 |+    pass
6 6 | 
7 7 | # Despite this `del`, `import os` in `f` should still be flagged as shadowing an unused
8 8 | # import. (This is a false negative, but is consistent with Pyflakes.)
