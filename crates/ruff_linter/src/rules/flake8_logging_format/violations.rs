///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// The `logging` module provides a mechanism for passing additional values to
/// be logged using the `extra` keyword argument. This is more consistent, more
/// efficient, and less error-prone than formatting the string directly.
///
/// Using `str.format` to format a logging message requires that Python eagerly
/// format the string, even if the logging statement is never executed (e.g.,
/// if the log level is above the level of the logging statement), whereas
/// using the `extra` keyword argument defers formatting until required.
///
/// Additionally, the use of `extra` will ensure that the values are made
/// available to all handlers, which can then be configured to log the values
/// in a consistent manner.
///
/// As an alternative to `extra`, passing values as arguments to the logging
/// method can also be used to defer string formatting until required.
///
/// ## Known problems
///
/// This rule detects uses of the `logging` module via a heuristic.
/// Specifically, it matches against:
///
/// - Uses of the `logging` module itself (e.g., `import logging; logging.info(...)`).
/// - Uses of `flask.current_app.logger` (e.g., `from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)`).
/// - Objects whose name starts with `log` or ends with `logger` or `logging`,
///   when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)`).
/// - Imported objects marked as loggers via the [`logger-objects`] setting, which can be
///   used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., `from module import logger; logger.info(...)`,
///   when [`logger-objects`] is set to `["module.logger"]`).
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// import logging
///
/// logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO)
///
/// user = "Maria"
///
/// logging.info("{} - Something happened".format(user))
