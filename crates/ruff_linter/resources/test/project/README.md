# project

An example multi-package Python project used to test setting resolution and other complex
behaviors.

## Expected behavior

Running from the repo root should pick up and enforce the appropriate settings for each package:

```console
∴ cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/.dotfiles/script.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/.dotfiles/script.py:1:8: F401 [*] `numpy` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/.dotfiles/script.py:2:17: F401 [*] `app.app_file` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:8:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/project/file.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/project/import_file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
Found 7 errors.
[*] 7 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Running from the project directory itself should exhibit the same behavior:

```console
∴ (cd crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/ && cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check .)
examples/.dotfiles/script.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
examples/.dotfiles/script.py:1:8: F401 [*] `numpy` imported but unused
examples/.dotfiles/script.py:2:17: F401 [*] `app.app_file` imported but unused
examples/docs/docs/file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
examples/docs/docs/file.py:8:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
project/file.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
project/import_file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
Found 7 errors.
[*] 7 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Running from the sub-package directory should exhibit the same behavior, but omit the top-level
files:

```console
∴ (cd crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs && cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check .)
docs/file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
docs/file.py:8:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
Found 2 errors.
[*] 2 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

`--config` should force Ruff to use the specified `pyproject.toml` for all files, and resolve
file paths from the current working directory:

```console
∴ (cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check --config=crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/pyproject.toml crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/)
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/.dotfiles/script.py:1:8: F401 [*] `numpy` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/.dotfiles/script.py:2:17: F401 [*] `app.app_file` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/concepts/file.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:3:8: F401 [*] `numpy` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/docs/docs/file.py:4:27: F401 [*] `docs.concepts.file` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/excluded/script.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/project/file.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
Found 9 errors.
[*] 9 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Running from a parent directory should "ignore" the `exclude` (hence, `concepts/file.py` gets
included in the output):

```console
∴ (cd crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples && cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check --config=docs/ruff.toml .)
docs/docs/concepts/file.py:5:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
docs/docs/file.py:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
docs/docs/file.py:8:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
excluded/script.py:5:5: F841 [*] Local variable `x` is assigned to but never used
Found 4 errors.
[*] 4 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Passing an excluded directory directly should report errors in the contained files:

```console
∴ cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/excluded/
crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/excluded/script.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Unless we `--force-exclude`:

```console
∴ cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/excluded/ --force-exclude
warning: No Python files found under the given path(s)
∴ cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/project/examples/excluded/script.py --force-exclude
warning: No Python files found under the given path(s)
```
