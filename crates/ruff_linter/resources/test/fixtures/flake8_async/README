Most of the ASYNC102* reference files have been copied from the flake8-async project.
Thanks to all the contributors over there that did all the work of identifying a
good feature set and for providing reference analysis code to test against.

https://github.com/python-trio/flake8-async/tree/b8422658298648e6791c74f1b455913f7e5fe1cb/tests/eval_files

for f in flake8-async/tests/eval_files/async102*; do F=$(echo "${f}" | sed 's;.*/async;ruff/crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_async/ASYNC;'); cp "${f}" "${F}"; done

After copying any updates, review for any existing modifications.  Mostly these would
be comments such as `# noqa: ASYNC102 - fixthis` for cases that are not yet properly
handled in the Ruff implementation of ASYNC102.

A naive check for the same error count is to grep as below.  Also make sure the grep
output itself does not contain any of the noqa comments noted about.

cat crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_async/ASYNC102* | grep -E '# (error|ASYNC102)' | wc -l
cat crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_async/ASYNC102* | grep -E '# (error|ASYNC102)' | grep '# noqa: ASYNC102' | wc -l
