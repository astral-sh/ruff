/// ## What it does
/// Checks for `while` loops.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// `while` loops can hard to read and understand. They are also prone to
/// infinite loops.
///
/// Often, a `while` loop can be rewritten as an alternative construct, such as
/// a `for` loop or context manager. These are often more explicit, less error
/// prone, and more easily optimized by the interpreter.
///
/// Exceptions to this are loops that are intended to run indefinitely, such as
/// event loops and listeners.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// i = n
/// while i > 0:
///     print(i)
///     i -= 1
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// for i in range(n, 0, -1):
///     print(i)
/// ```
