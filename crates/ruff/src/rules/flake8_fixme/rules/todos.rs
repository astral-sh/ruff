/// ## What it does
/// Checks for "TODO" comments.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// "TODO" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
/// (usually, a missing feature, optimization, or refactoring opportunity).
///
/// Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.
///
/// Note that if you use "TODO" comments as a form of documentation (e.g.,
/// to [provide context for future work](https://gist.github.com/dmnd/ed5d8ef8de2e4cfea174bd5dafcda382)),
/// this rule may not be appropriate for your project.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def greet(name):
///     return f"Hello, {name}!"  # TODO: Add support for custom greetings.
/// ```

/// ## What it does
/// Checks for "FIXME" comments.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// "FIXME" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
/// (usually, a bug or unexpected behavior).
///
/// Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.
///
/// Note that if you use "FIXME" comments as a form of documentation, this
/// rule may not be appropriate for your project.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def speed(distance, time):
///     return distance / time  # FIXME: Raises ZeroDivisionError for time = 0.
/// ```
#[violation]
pub struct LineContainsFixme;
impl Violation for LineContainsFixme {

/// ## What it does
/// Checks for "XXX" comments.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// "XXX" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved.
///
/// Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code, or, at minimum,
/// using a more descriptive comment tag (e.g, "TODO").
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def speed(distance, time):
///     return distance / time  # XXX: Raises ZeroDivisionError for time = 0.
/// ```

}

/// ## What it does
/// Checks for "HACK" comments.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// "HACK" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
/// (usually, a suboptimal solution or temporary workaround).
///
/// Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.
///
/// Note that if you use "HACK" comments as a form of documentation, this
/// rule may not be appropriate for your project.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// import os
///
///
/// def running_windows():  # HACK: Use platform module instead.
///     try:
///         os.mkdir("C:\\Windows\\System32\\")
///     except FileExistsError:
///         return True
///     else:
///         os.rmdir("C:\\Windows\\System32\\")
///         return False
/// ```
