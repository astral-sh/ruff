/// ## What it does
/// Checks for member imports that should instead be accessed by importing the
/// module.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Consistency is good. Use a common convention for imports to make your code
/// more readable and idiomatic.
///
/// For example, it's common to import `pandas` as `pd`, and then access
/// members like `Series` via `pd.Series`, rather than importing `Series`
/// directly.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// from pandas import Series
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// import pandas as pd
///
/// pd.Series
/// ```
