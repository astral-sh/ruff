# unused-import (F401)

Derived from the **Pyflakes** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does
Checks for unused imports.

## Why is this bad?
Unused imports add a performance overhead at runtime, and risk creating
import cycles. They also increase the cognitive load of reading the code.

If an import statement is used to check for the availability or existence
of a module, consider using `importlib.util.find_spec` instead.

If an import statement is used to re-export a symbol as part of a module's
public interface, consider using a "redundant" import alias, which
instructs Ruff (and other tools) to respect the re-export, and avoid
marking it as unused, as in:

```python
from module import member as member
```

Alternatively, you can use `__all__` to declare a symbol as part of the module's
interface, as in:

```python
# __init__.py
import some_module

__all__ = ["some_module"]
```

## Fix safety

Fixes to remove unused imports are safe, except in `__init__.py` files.

Applying fixes to `__init__.py` files is currently in preview. The fix offered depends on the
type of the unused import. Ruff will suggest a safe fix to export first-party imports with
either a redundant alias or, if already present in the file, an `__all__` entry. If multiple
`__all__` declarations are present, Ruff will not offer a fix. Ruff will suggest an unsafe fix
to remove third-party and standard library imports -- the fix is unsafe because the module's
interface changes.

## Example

```python
import numpy as np  # unused import


def area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius**2
```

Use instead:

```python
def area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius**2
```

To check the availability of a module, use `importlib.util.find_spec`:

```python
from importlib.util import find_spec

if find_spec("numpy") is not None:
    print("numpy is installed")
else:
    print("numpy is not installed")
```
