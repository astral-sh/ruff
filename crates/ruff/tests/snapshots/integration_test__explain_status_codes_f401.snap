# unused-import (F401)

Derived from the **Pyflakes** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does
Checks for unused imports.

## Why is this bad?
Unused imports add a performance overhead at runtime, and risk creating
import cycles. They also increase the cognitive load of reading the code.

If an import statement is used to check for the availability or existence
of a module, consider using `importlib.util.find_spec` instead.

If an import statement is used to re-export a symbol as part of a module's
public interface, consider using a "redundant" import alias, which
instructs Ruff (and other tools) to respect the re-export, and avoid
marking it as unused, as in:

```python
from module import member as member
```

## Example
```python
import numpy as np  # unused import


def area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius**2
```

Use instead:
```python
def area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius**2
```

To check the availability of a module, use `importlib.util.find_spec`:
```python
from importlib.util import find_spec

if find_spec("numpy") is not None:
    print("numpy is installed")
else:
    print("numpy is not installed")
```

## Options
- `lint.ignore-init-module-imports`
