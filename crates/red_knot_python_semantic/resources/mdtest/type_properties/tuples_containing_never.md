# Tuples containing `Never`

A heterogeneous `tuple[â€¦]` type that contains `Never` as a type argument simplifies to `Never`. One
way to think about this is the following: in order to construct a tuple, you need to have an object
of every element type. But since there is no object of type `Never`, you cannot construct the tuple.
Such a tuple type is therefore uninhabited and equivalent to `Never`.

In the language of algebraic data types, a tuple type is a product type and `Never` acts like the
zero element in multiplication, similar to how a Cartesian product with the empty set is the empty
set.

```py
from knot_extensions import static_assert, is_equivalent_to
from typing_extensions import Never, NoReturn

static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[Never]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[Never, int]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[int, Never]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[int, Never, str]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[int, tuple[str, Never]]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[tuple[str, Never], int]))

# The empty tuple is *not* equivalent to Never!
static_assert(not is_equivalent_to(Never, tuple[()]))

# NoReturn is just a different spelling of Never, so the same is true for NoReturn
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[NoReturn]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[NoReturn, int]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[int, NoReturn]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[int, NoReturn, str]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[int, tuple[str, NoReturn]]))
static_assert(is_equivalent_to(NoReturn, tuple[tuple[str, NoReturn], int]))
```
