# Stepsize zero in slices

We raise a `zero-stepsize-in-slice` diagnostic when trying to slice a literal
string, bytes, or tuple with a step size of zero (see tests in `string.md`,
`bytes.md` and `tuple.md`). But we don't want to raise this diagnostic when
slicing a custom type:

```py
class MySequence:
    def __getitem__(self, s: slice) -> int:
        return 0

MySequence()[0:1:0]  # No error
```
