# Environment variables

ty defines and respects the following environment variables:

### `TY_LOG`

If set, ty will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output.
Accepts any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate.

For example:

- `TY_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of `-vv` to the command line
- `TY_LOG=trace` will enable all trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax)
for more.

### `TY_LOG_PROFILE`

If set to `"1"` or `"true"`, ty will enable flamegraph profiling.
This creates a `tracing.folded` file that can be used to generate flame graphs
for performance analysis.

### `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of tasks ty is allowed to run in parallel.

For example, how many files should be checked in parallel.
This isn't the same as a thread limit. ty may spawn additional threads
when necessary, e.g. to watch for file system changes or a dedicated UI thread.

## Externally-defined variables

ty also reads the following externally defined environment variables:

### `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`

Used to determine the name of the active Conda environment.

### `CONDA_PREFIX`

Used to detect the path of an active Conda environment.
If both `VIRTUAL_ENV` and `CONDA_PREFIX` are present, `VIRTUAL_ENV` will be preferred.

### `PYTHONPATH`

Adds additional directories to ty's search paths.
The format is the same as the shellâ€™s PATH:
one or more directory pathnames separated by os appropriate pathsep
(e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows).

### `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of threads ty uses when performing work in parallel.
Equivalent to `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`.

This is a standard Rayon environment variable.

### `VIRTUAL_ENV`

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

### `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

Path to user-level configuration directory on Unix systems.

### `_CONDA_ROOT`

Used to determine the root install path of Conda.
