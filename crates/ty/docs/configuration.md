# Configuration
#### `rules`

Configures the enabled rules and their severity.

See [the rules documentation](https://ty.dev/rules) for a list of all available rules.

Valid severities are:

* `ignore`: Disable the rule.
* `warn`: Enable the rule and create a warning diagnostic.
* `error`: Enable the rule and create an error diagnostic.
  ty will exit with a non-zero code if any error diagnostics are emitted.

**Default value**: `{...}`

**Type**: `dict[RuleName, "ignore" | "warn" | "error"]`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.rules]
possibly-unresolved-reference = "warn"
division-by-zero = "ignore"
```

---

## `environment`

#### `extra-paths`

List of user-provided paths that should take first priority in the module resolution.
Examples in other type checkers are mypy's `MYPYPATH` environment variable,
or pyright's `stubPath` configuration setting.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
extra-paths = ["~/shared/my-search-path"]
```

---

#### `python`

Path to the Python installation from which ty resolves type information and third-party dependencies.

ty will search in the path's `site-packages` directories for type information and
third-party imports.

This option is commonly used to specify the path to a virtual environment.

**Default value**: `null`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
python = "./.venv"
```

---

#### `python-platform`

Specifies the target platform that will be used to analyze the source code.
If specified, ty will understand conditions based on comparisons with `sys.platform`, such
as are commonly found in typeshed to reflect the differing contents of the standard library across platforms.
If `all` is specified, ty will assume that the source code can run on any platform.

If no platform is specified, ty will use the current platform:
- `win32` for Windows
- `darwin` for macOS
- `android` for Android
- `ios` for iOS
- `linux` for everything else

**Default value**: `<current-platform>`

**Type**: `"win32" | "darwin" | "android" | "ios" | "linux" | "all" | str`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
# Tailor type stubs and conditionalized type definitions to windows.
python-platform = "win32"
```

---

#### `python-version`

Specifies the version of Python that will be used to analyze the source code.
The version should be specified as a string in the format `M.m` where `M` is the major version
and `m` is the minor (e.g. `"3.0"` or `"3.6"`).
If a version is provided, ty will generate errors if the source code makes use of language features
that are not supported in that version.

If a version is not specified, ty will try the following techniques in order of preference
to determine a value:
1. Check for the `project.requires-python` setting in a `pyproject.toml` file
   and use the minimum version from the specified range
2. Check for an activated or configured Python environment
   and attempt to infer the Python version of that environment
3. Fall back to the default value (see below)

For some language features, ty can also understand conditionals based on comparisons
with `sys.version_info`. These are commonly found in typeshed, for example,
to reflect the differing contents of the standard library across Python versions.

**Default value**: `"3.13"`

**Type**: `"3.7" | "3.8" | "3.9" | "3.10" | "3.11" | "3.12" | "3.13" | <major>.<minor>`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
python-version = "3.12"
```

---

#### `typeshed`

Optional path to a "typeshed" directory on disk for us to use for standard-library types.
If this is not provided, we will fallback to our vendored typeshed stubs for the stdlib,
bundled as a zip file in the binary

**Default value**: `null`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
typeshed = "/path/to/custom/typeshed"
```

---

## `src`

#### `exclude`

A list of file and directory patterns to exclude from type checking.

Patterns follow a syntax similar to `.gitignore`:
- `./src/` matches only a directory
- `./src` matches both files and directories
- `src` matches files or directories named `src` anywhere in the tree (e.g. `./src` or `./tests/src`)
- `*` matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters (except `/`).
- `**` matches zero or more path components.
  This sequence **must** form a single path component, so both `**a` and `b**` are invalid and will result in an error.
  A sequence of more than two consecutive `*` characters is also invalid.
- `?` matches any single character except `/`
- `[abc]` matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode,
  so e.g. `[0-9]` specifies any character between `0` and `9` inclusive. An unclosed bracket is invalid.
- `!pattern` negates a pattern (undoes the exclusion of files that would otherwise be excluded)

By default, the following directories are excluded:

- `.bzr`
- `.direnv`
- `.eggs`
- `.git`
- `.git-rewrite`
- `.hg`
- `.mypy_cache`
- `.nox`
- `.pants.d`
- `.pytype`
- `.ruff_cache`
- `.svn`
- `.tox`
- `.venv`
- `__pypackages__`
- `_build`
- `buck-out`
- `dist`
- `node_modules`
- `venv`

You can override any default exclude by using a negated pattern. For example,
to re-include `dist` use `exclude = ["!dist"]`

**Default value**: `null`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.src]
exclude = [
    "generated",
    "*.proto",
    "tests/fixtures/**",
    "!tests/fixtures/important.py"  # Include this one file
]
```

---

#### `respect-ignore-files`

Whether to automatically exclude files that are ignored by `.ignore`,
`.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, and global `gitignore` files.
Enabled by default.

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.src]
respect-ignore-files = false
```

---

#### `root`

The root of the project, used for finding first-party modules.

If left unspecified, ty will try to detect common project layouts and initialize `src.root` accordingly:

* if a `./src` directory exists, include `.` and `./src` in the first party search path (src layout or flat)
* if a `./<project-name>/<project-name>` directory exists, include `.` and `./<project-name>` in the first party search path
* otherwise, default to `.` (flat layout)

Besides, if a `./tests` directory exists and is not a package (i.e. it does not contain an `__init__.py` file),
it will also be included in the first party search path.

**Default value**: `null`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.src]
root = "./app"
```

---

## `terminal`

#### `error-on-warning`

Use exit code 1 if there are any warning-level diagnostics.

Defaults to `false`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.terminal]
# Error if ty emits any warning-level diagnostics.
error-on-warning = true
```

---

#### `output-format`

The format to use for printing diagnostic messages.

Defaults to `full`.

**Default value**: `full`

**Type**: `full | concise`

**Example usage** (`pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[tool.ty.terminal]
output-format = "concise"
```
