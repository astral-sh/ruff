/// Stores one or more _association lists_, which are linked lists of key/value pairs. We

/// that they do not contain any entries with duplicate keys.
///
/// Association lists have fallen out of favor in recent decades, since you often need operations
/// that are inefficient on them. In particular, looking up a random element by index is O(n), just
/// like a linked list; and looking up an element by key is also O(n), since you must do a linear
/// scan of the list to find the matching element. The typical implementation also suffers from
/// poor cache locality and high memory allocation overhead, since individual list cells are
/// typically allocated separately from the heap.
///
/// We solve that last problem by storing the cells of an association list in an [`IndexVec`]
/// arena. You provide the index type (`I`) that you want to use with this arena. That means that
/// an individual association list is represented by an `Option<I>`, with `None` representing an
/// empty list.
///
/// We exploit structural sharing where possible, reusing cells across multiple lists when we can.
/// That said, we don't guarantee that lists are canonical â€” it's entirely possible for two lists
/// with identical contents to use different list cells and have different identifiers.
///
/// This type provides read-only access to the lists.  Use a [`ListBuilder`] to create lists.
