# ty configuration for Django type checking comparison
#
# To test ty with django-stubs, install them in your Python environment:
#   uvx --with django-stubs --with django python -c "import django"
#
# Then configure ty to use that environment:
#   [environment]
#   python = "/path/to/your/python/env"
#
# Or create a virtual environment with uv:
#   uv venv
#   uv pip install django django-stubs
#
# Then uncomment and update:
# [environment]
# python = ".venv/bin/python"
