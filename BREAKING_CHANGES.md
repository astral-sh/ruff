### Configuration files are now resolved hierarchically ([#1190](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1190))

`pyproject.toml` files are now resolved hierarchically, such that for each Python file, we find
the first `pyproject.toml` file in its path, and use that to determine its lint settings.

See the [README](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#pyprojecttoml-discovery) for more.
