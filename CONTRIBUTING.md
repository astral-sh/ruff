# Contributing to Ruff

Welcome! We're happy to have you here. Thank you in advance for your contribution to Ruff.

## The basics

Ruff welcomes contributions in the form of Pull Requests. For small changes (e.g., bug fixes), feel
free to submit a PR. For larger changes (e.g., new lint rules, new functionality, new configuration
options), consider submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues) outlining
your proposed change.

If you're looking for a place to start, we recommend implementing a new lint rule (see:
[_Adding a new lint rule_](#example-adding-a-new-lint-rule), which will allow you to learn from and
pattern-match against the examples in the existing codebase. Many lint rules are inspired by
existing Python plugins, which can be used as a reference implementation.

As a concrete example: consider taking on one of the rules in [`flake8-simplify`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/998),
and looking to the originating [Python source](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify) for
guidance.

### Prerequisites

Ruff is written in Rust. You'll need to install the
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for development.

You'll also need [Insta](https://insta.rs/docs/) to update snapshot tests:

```shell
cargo install cargo-insta
```

### Development

After cloning the repository, run Ruff locally with:

```shell
cargo run resources/test/fixtures --no-cache
```

Prior to opening a pull request, ensure that your code has been auto-formatted,
and that it passes both the lint and test validation checks.

For rustfmt and Clippy, we use [nightly Rust][nightly], as it is stricter than stable Rust.
(However, tests and builds use stable Rust.)

```shell
cargo +nightly fmt --all     # Auto-formatting...
cargo +nightly clippy --fix --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -W clippy::pedantic  # Linting...
cargo test --all    # Testing...
```

These checks will run on GitHub Actions when you open your Pull Request, but running them locally
will save you time and expedite the merge process.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by a maintainer, which may involve a few rounds of iteration
prior to merging.

### Example: Adding a new lint rule

At a high level, the steps involved in adding a new lint rule are as follows:

1. Create a file for your rule (e.g., `src/rules/flake8_bugbear/rules/abstract_base_class.rs`).
2. In that file, define a violation struct. You can grep for `define_violation!` to see examples.
3. Map the violation struct to a rule code in `src/registry.rs` (e.g., `E402`).
4. Define the logic for triggering the violation in `src/checkers/ast.rs` (for AST-based checks),
   `src/checkers/tokens.rs` (for token-based checks), `src/checkers/lines.rs` (for text-based
   checks), or `src/checkers/filesystem.rs` (for filesystem-based checks).
5. Add a test fixture.
6. Update the generated files (documentation and generated code).

To define the violation, start by creating a dedicated file for your rule under the appropriate
rule origin (e.g., `src/rules/flake8_bugbear/rules/abstract_base_class.rs`). That file should
contain a struct defined via `define_violation!`, along with a function that creates the violation
based on any required inputs. (Many of the existing examples live in `src/violations.rs`, but we're
looking to place new rules in their own files.)

To trigger the violation, you'll likely want to augment the logic in `src/checkers/ast.rs`, which
defines the Python AST visitor, responsible for iterating over the abstract syntax tree and
collecting diagnostics as it goes.

If you need to inspect the AST, you can run `cargo +nightly dev print-ast` with a Python file. Grep
for the `Check::new` invocations to understand how other, similar rules are implemented.

To add a test fixture, create a file under `resources/test/fixtures/[origin]`, named to match
the code you defined earlier (e.g., `resources/test/fixtures/pycodestyle/E402.py`). This file should
contain a variety of violations and non-violations designed to evaluate and demonstrate the behavior
of your lint rule.

Run `cargo +nightly dev generate-all` to generate the code for your new fixture. Then run Ruff
locally with (e.g.) `cargo run resources/test/fixtures/pycodestyle/E402.py --no-cache --select E402`.

Once you're satisfied with the output, codify the behavior as a snapshot test by adding a new
`test_case` macro in the relevant `src/[origin]/mod.rs` file. Then, run `cargo test --all`.
Your test will fail, but you'll be prompted to follow-up with `cargo insta review`. Accept the
generated snapshot, then commit the snapshot file alongside the rest of your changes.

Finally, regenerate the documentation and generated code with `cargo +nightly dev generate-all`.

### Example: Adding a new configuration option

Ruff's user-facing settings live in a few different places.

First, the command-line options are defined via the `Cli` struct in `src/cli.rs`.

Second, the `pyproject.toml` options are defined in `src/settings/options.rs` (via the `Options`
struct), `src/settings/configuration.rs` (via the `Configuration` struct), and `src/settings/mod.rs`
(via the `Settings` struct). These represent, respectively: the schema used to parse the
`pyproject.toml` file; an internal, intermediate representation; and the final, internal
representation used to power Ruff.

To add a new configuration option, you'll likely want to modify these latter few files (along with
`cli.rs`, if appropriate). If you want to pattern-match against an existing example, grep for
`dummy_variable_rgx`, which defines a regular expression to match against acceptable unused
variables (e.g., `_`).

Note that plugin-specific configuration options are defined in their own modules (e.g.,
`src/flake8_unused_arguments/settings.rs`).

You may also want to add the new configuration option to the `flake8-to-ruff` tool, which is
responsible for converting `flake8` configuration files to Ruff's TOML format. This logic
lives in `flake8_to_ruff/src/converter.rs`.

Finally, regenerate the documentation and generated code with `cargo +nightly dev generate-all`.

## Release process

As of now, Ruff has an ad hoc release process: releases are cut with high frequency via GitHub
Actions, which automatically generates the appropriate wheels across architectures and publishes
them to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/).

Ruff follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning standard. However, as pre-1.0 software,
even patch releases may contain [non-backwards-compatible changes](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).
