# Configures a drive for testing in CI.
#
# When using standard GitHub Actions runners, a `D:` drive is present and has
# similar or better performance characteristics than a ReFS dev drive. Sometimes
# using a larger runner is still more performant (e.g., when running the test
# suite) and we need to create a dev drive. This script automatically configures
# the appropriate drive.
#
# When using GitHub Actions' "larger runners", the `D:` drive is not present and
# we create a DevDrive mount on `C:`. This is purported to be more performant
# than an ReFS drive, though we did not see a change when we switched over.
#
# When using Depot runners, the underling infrastructure is EC2, which does not
# support Hyper-V. The `New-VHD` commandlet only works with Hyper-V, but we can
# create a ReFS drive using `diskpart` and `format` directory. We cannot use a
# DevDrive, as that also requires Hyper-V. The Depot runners use `D:` already,
# so we must check if it's a Depot runner first, and we use `V:` as the target
# instead.
