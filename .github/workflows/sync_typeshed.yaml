name: Sync typeshed

# How this works:
#
# 1. A Linux worker:
#    a. Checks out Ruff and typeshed
#    b. Deletes the vendored typeshed stdlib stubs from Ruff
#    c. Copies the latest versions of the stubs from typeshed
#    d. Uses docstring-adder to sync all docstrings available on Linux
#    e. Creates a new branch on the upstream astral-sh/ruff repository
#    f. Commits the changes it's made and pushes them to the new upstream branch
# 2. Once the Linux worker is done, a Windows worker:
#    a. Checks out the branch created by the Linux worker
#    b. Syncs all docstrings available on Windows that are not available on Linux
#    c. Commits the changes and pushes them to the same upstream branch
# 3. Once the Windows worker is done, a MacOS worker:
#    a. Checks out the branch created by the Linux worker
#    b. Syncs all docstrings available on MacOS that are not available on Linux or Windows
#    c. Formats the code again
#    d. Commits the changes and pushes them to the same upstream branch
#    e. Creates a PR against the `main` branch using the branch all three workers have pushed to
# 4. If any of steps 1-3 failed, an issue is created in the `astral-sh/ruff` repository
