    # it's hard to test what the impact of removing these ignores would be
    # without actually running the release workflow...

    # `cargo dist` makes extensive use of `secrets: inherit`,
    # and we can't easily fix that until an upstream release changes that.

  template-injection:
    ignore:
      # like with `secrets-inherit`, `cargo dist` introduces some
      # template injections. We've manually audited these usages for safety.
