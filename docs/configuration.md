# Configuring Ruff

Ruff can be configured through a `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, or `.ruff.toml` file.

Whether you're using Ruff as a linter, formatter, or both, the underlying configuration strategy and
semantics are the same.

For a complete enumeration of the available configuration options, see [_Settings_](settings.md).

If left unspecified, Ruff's default configuration is equivalent to:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml

    docstring-code-format = false

    # Set the line length limit used when formatting code snippets in
    # docstrings.
    #
    # This only has an effect when the `docstring-code-format` setting is
    # enabled.
    docstring-code-line-length = "dynamic"
    ```

As an example, the following would configure Ruff to:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff.lint]
    # 1. Enable flake8-bugbear (`B`) rules, in addition to the defaults.
    select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F", "B"]

    # 2. Avoid enforcing line-length violations (`E501`)
    ignore = ["E501"]

    # 3. Avoid trying to fix flake8-bugbear (`B`) violations.
    unfixable = ["B"]

    # 4. Ignore `E402` (import violations) in all `__init__.py` files, and in select subdirectories.
    [tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
    "__init__.py" = ["E402"]
    "**/{tests,docs,tools}/*" = ["E402"]

    [tool.ruff.format]
    # 5. Use single quotes for non-triple-quoted strings.
    quote-style = "single"
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    [lint]
    # 1. Enable flake8-bugbear (`B`) rules, in addition to the defaults.
    select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F", "B"]

    # 2. Avoid enforcing line-length violations (`E501`)
    ignore = ["E501"]

    # 3. Avoid trying to fix flake8-bugbear (`B`) violations.
    unfixable = ["B"]

    # 4. Ignore `E402` (import violations) in all `__init__.py` files, and in select subdirectories.
    [lint.per-file-ignores]
    "__init__.py" = ["E402"]
    "**/{tests,docs,tools}/*" = ["E402"]

    [format]
    # 5. Use single quotes for non-triple-quoted strings.
    quote-style = "single"
    ```

Linter plugin configurations are expressed as subsections, e.g.:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff.lint]
    # Add "Q" to the list of enabled codes.
    select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F", "Q"]

    [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
    docstring-quotes = "double"
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    [lint]
    # Add "Q" to the list of enabled codes.
    select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F", "Q"]

    [lint.flake8-quotes]
    docstring-quotes = "double"
    ```

Ruff respects `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, and `.ruff.toml` files. All three implement an
equivalent schema (though in the `ruff.toml` and `.ruff.toml` versions, the `[tool.ruff]` header and
`tool.ruff` section prefix is omitted).

For a complete enumeration of the available configuration options, see [_Settings_](settings.md).

## Config file discovery

Similar to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy),
Ruff supports hierarchical configuration, such that the "closest" config file in the
directory hierarchy is used for every individual file, with all paths in the config file
(e.g., `exclude` globs, `src` paths) being resolved relative to the directory containing that
config file.

There are a few exceptions to these rules:

1. In locating the "closest" `pyproject.toml` file for a given path, Ruff ignores any
    `pyproject.toml` files that lack a `[tool.ruff]` section.
1. If a configuration file is passed directly via `--config`, those settings are used for _all_
    analyzed files, and any relative paths in that configuration file (like `exclude` globs or
    `src` paths) are resolved relative to the _current_ working directory.
1. If no config file is found in the filesystem hierarchy, Ruff will fall back to using
    a default configuration. If a user-specific configuration file exists
    at `${config_dir}/ruff/pyproject.toml`, that file will be used instead of the default
    configuration, with `${config_dir}` being determined via the [`dirs`](https://docs.rs/dirs/4.0.0/dirs/fn.config_dir.html)
    crate, and all relative paths being again resolved relative to the _current working directory_.
1. Any config-file-supported settings that are provided on the command-line (e.g., via
    `--select`) will override the settings in _every_ resolved configuration file.

Unlike [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy),
Ruff does not merge settings across configuration files; instead, the "closest" configuration file
is used, and any parent configuration files are ignored. In lieu of this implicit cascade, Ruff
supports an [`extend`](settings.md#extend) field, which allows you to inherit the settings from another
config file, like so:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    # Extend the `pyproject.toml` file in the parent directory...
    extend = "../pyproject.toml"

    # ...but use a different line length.
    line-length = 100
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    # Extend the `ruff.toml` file in the parent directory...
    extend = "../ruff.toml"

    # ...but use a different line length.
    line-length = 100
    ```

All of the above rules apply equivalently to `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, and `.ruff.toml` files.
If Ruff detects multiple configuration files in the same directory, the `.ruff.toml` file will take
precedence over the `ruff.toml` file, and the `ruff.toml` file will take precedence over
the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Python file discovery

When passed a path on the command-line, Ruff will automatically discover all Python files in that
path, taking into account the [`exclude`](settings.md#exclude) and [`extend-exclude`](settings.md#extend-exclude)
settings in each directory's configuration file.

Files can also be selectively excluded from linting or formatting by scoping the `exclude` setting
to the tool-specific configuration tables. For example, the following would prevent `ruff` from
formatting `.pyi` files, but would continue to include them in linting:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff.format]
    exclude = ["*.pyi"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    [format]
    exclude = ["*.pyi"]
    ```

By default, Ruff will also skip any files that are omitted via `.ignore`, `.gitignore`,
`.git/info/exclude`, and global `gitignore` files (see: [`respect-gitignore`](settings.md#respect-gitignore)).

Files that are passed to `ruff` directly are always analyzed, regardless of the above criteria.
For example, `ruff check /path/to/excluded/file.py` will always lint `file.py`.

### Default inclusions

By default, Ruff will discover files matching `*.py`, `*.ipy`, or `pyproject.toml`.

To lint or format files with additional file extensions, use the [`extend-include`](settings.md#extend-include) setting.

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

You can also change the default selection using the [`include`](settings.md#include) setting.


=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    include = ["pyproject.toml", "src/**/*.py", "scripts/**/*.py"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    include = ["pyproject.toml", "src/**/*.py", "scripts/**/*.py"]
    ```

!!! warning
    Paths provided to `include` _must_ match files. For example, `include = ["src"]` will fail since it
    matches a directory.

## Jupyter Notebook discovery

Ruff has built-in support for [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

To opt in to linting and formatting Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, add the `*.ipynb` pattern to
your [`extend-include`](settings.md#extend-include) setting, like so:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

This will prompt Ruff to discover Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files in any specified
directories, then lint and format them accordingly.

If you'd prefer to either only lint or only format Jupyter Notebook files, you can use the
section specific `exclude` option to do so. For example, the following would only lint Jupyter
Notebook files and not format them:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]

    [tool.ruff.format]
    exclude = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]

    [format]
    exclude = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

And, conversely, the following would only format Jupyter Notebook files and not lint them:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]

    [tool.ruff.lint]
    exclude = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

=== "ruff.toml"

    ```toml
    extend-include = ["*.ipynb"]

    [lint]
    exclude = ["*.ipynb"]
    ```

Alternatively, pass the notebook file(s) to `ruff` on the command-line directly. For example,
`ruff check /path/to/notebook.ipynb` will always lint `notebook.ipynb`. Similarly,
`ruff format /path/to/notebook.ipynb` will always format `notebook.ipynb`.

## Command-line interface

Some configuration options can be provided or overridden via dedicated flags on the command line.
This includes those related to rule enablement and disablement,
file discovery, logging level, and more:

```shell
ruff check path/to/code/ --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

All other configuration options can be set via the command line
using the `--config` flag, detailed below.

### The `--config` CLI flag

The `--config` flag has two uses. It is most often used to point to the
configuration file that you would like Ruff to use, for example:

```shell
ruff check path/to/directory --config path/to/ruff.toml
```

However, the `--config` flag can also be used to provide arbitrary
overrides of configuration settings using TOML `<KEY> = <VALUE>` pairs.
This is mostly useful in situations where you wish to override a configuration setting
that does not have a dedicated command-line flag.

In the below example, the `--config` flag is the only way of overriding the
`dummy-variable-rgx` configuration setting from the command line,
since this setting has no dedicated CLI flag. The `per-file-ignores` setting
could also have been overridden via the `--per-file-ignores` dedicated flag,
but using `--config` to override the setting is also fine:

```shell
ruff check path/to/file --config path/to/ruff.toml --config "lint.dummy-variable-rgx = '__.*'" --config "lint.per-file-ignores = {'some_file.py' = ['F841']}"
```

Configuration options passed to `--config` are parsed in the same way
as configuration options in a `ruff.toml` file.
As such, options specific to the Ruff linter need to be prefixed with `lint.`
(`--config "lint.dummy-variable-rgx = '__.*'"` rather than simply
`--config "dummy-variable-rgx = '__.*'"`), and options specific to the Ruff formatter
need to be prefixed with `format.`.

If a specific configuration option is simultaneously overridden by
a dedicated flag and by the `--config` flag, the dedicated flag
takes priority. In this example, the maximum permitted line length
will be set to 90, not 100:

```shell
ruff format path/to/file --line-length=90 --config "line-length=100"
```

Specifying `--config "line-length=90"` will override the `line-length`
setting from *all* configuration files detected by Ruff,
including configuration files discovered in subdirectories.
In this respect, specifying `--config "line-length=90"` has
the same effect as specifying `--line-length=90`,
which will similarly override the `line-length` setting from
all configuration files detected by Ruff, regardless of where
a specific configuration file is located.

  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging
  -q, --quiet    Print diagnostics, but nothing else
  -s, --silent   Disable all logging (but still exit with status code "1" upon
                 detecting diagnostics)

Global options:
      --config <CONFIG_OPTION>
          Either a path to a TOML configuration file (`pyproject.toml` or
          `ruff.toml`), or a TOML `<KEY> = <VALUE>` pair (such as you might
          find in a `ruff.toml` configuration file) overriding a specific
          configuration option. Overrides of individual settings using this
          option always take precedence over all configuration files, including
          configuration files that were also specified using `--config`
      --isolated
          Ignore all configuration files

Or `ruff help format` for more on the formatting command:

<!-- Begin auto-generated format help. -->

```text
Run the Ruff formatter on the given files or directories

Usage: ruff format [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

Arguments:
  [FILES]...  List of files or directories to format [default: .]

Options:
      --check
          Avoid writing any formatted files back; instead, exit with a non-zero
          status code if any files would have been modified, and zero otherwise
      --diff
          Avoid writing any formatted files back; instead, exit with a non-zero
          status code and the difference between the current file and how the
          formatted file would look like
      --extension <EXTENSION>
          List of mappings from file extension to language (one of `python`,
          `ipynb`, `pyi`). For example, to treat `.ipy` files as IPython
          notebooks, use `--extension ipy:ipynb`
      --target-version <TARGET_VERSION>
          The minimum Python version that should be supported [possible values:
          py37, py38, py39, py310, py311, py312, py313]
      --preview
          Enable preview mode; enables unstable formatting. Use `--no-preview`
          to disable
  -h, --help
          Print help (see more with '--help')

Miscellaneous:
  -n, --no-cache
          Disable cache reads [env: RUFF_NO_CACHE=]
      --cache-dir <CACHE_DIR>
          Path to the cache directory [env: RUFF_CACHE_DIR=]
      --stdin-filename <STDIN_FILENAME>
          The name of the file when passing it through stdin

File selection:
      --respect-gitignore
          Respect file exclusions via `.gitignore` and other standard ignore
          files. Use `--no-respect-gitignore` to disable
      --exclude <FILE_PATTERN>
          List of paths, used to omit files and/or directories from analysis
      --force-exclude
          Enforce exclusions, even for paths passed to Ruff directly on the
          command-line. Use `--no-force-exclude` to disable

Format configuration:
      --line-length <LINE_LENGTH>  Set the line-length

Editor options:
      --range <RANGE>  When specified, Ruff will try to only format the code in
                       the given range.
                       It might be necessary to extend the start backwards or
                       the end forwards, to fully enclose a logical line.
                       The `<RANGE>` uses the format
                       `<start_line>:<start_column>-<end_line>:<end_column>`.

Log levels:
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging
  -q, --quiet    Print diagnostics, but nothing else
  -s, --silent   Disable all logging (but still exit with status code "1" upon
                 detecting diagnostics)

Global options:
      --config <CONFIG_OPTION>
          Either a path to a TOML configuration file (`pyproject.toml` or
          `ruff.toml`), or a TOML `<KEY> = <VALUE>` pair (such as you might
          find in a `ruff.toml` configuration file) overriding a specific
          configuration option. Overrides of individual settings using this
          option always take precedence over all configuration files, including
          configuration files that were also specified using `--config`
      --isolated
          Ignore all configuration files

## Shell autocompletion

Ruff supports autocompletion for most shells. A shell-specific completion script can be generated
by `ruff generate-shell-completion <SHELL>`, where `<SHELL>` is one of `bash`, `elvish`, `fig`, `fish`,
`powershell`, or `zsh`.

The exact steps required to enable autocompletion will vary by shell. For example instructions,
see the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#enable-tab-completion-for-bash-fish-or-zsh) or
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#complete) documentation.

As an example: to enable autocompletion for Zsh, run
`ruff generate-shell-completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_ruff`. Then add the following line to your
`~/.zshrc` file, if they're not already present:

```zsh
fpath+=~/.zfunc
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```
