# RustPython parser as a library

This project is forked from [RustPython][RustPython] project. The parser is one of the core part of [RustPython] and [Ruff] project.

We try to keep these crates as a well-packaged library for more potential users.

## Projects

- [RustPython][RustPython] is a Python interpreter
- [Ruff][Ruff] is an extremely fast Python linter
- [Pylyzer][Pylyzer] is a static code analyzer / language server for Python
- [Baembal][Baembal] is a Python package to accelerate `ast.parse`
