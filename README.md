Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/), [pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/),
[yesqa](https://github.com/asottile/yesqa), [eradicate](https://pypi.org/project/eradicate/),
[pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/), and [autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/),
all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
* [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
* [Transformers (Hugging Face)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
* [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and many more.

```

<!-- End section: Installation and Usage -->

## Configuration

<!-- Begin section: Configuration -->

Ruff can be configured via a `pyproject.toml` file, a `ruff.toml` file, or through the command line.

For a complete enumeration of the available configuration options, see the
[documentation](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/).

### Configure via `pyproject.toml`

If left unspecified, the default configuration is equivalent to:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Enable Pyflakes `E` and `F` codes by default.
select = ["E", "F"]
ignore = []

# Allow autofix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "..."]
unfixable = []

# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    ".bzr",
    ".direnv",
    ".eggs",
    ".git",
    ".hg",
    ".mypy_cache",
    ".nox",
    ".pants.d",
    ".pytype",
    ".ruff_cache",
    ".svn",
    ".tox",
    ".venv",
    "__pypackages__",
    "_build",
    "buck-out",
    "build",
    "dist",
    "node_modules",
    "venv",
]
per-file-ignores = {}

# Same as Black.
line-length = 88

# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = "^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$"

# Assume Python 3.10.
target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.mccabe]
# Unlike Flake8, default to a complexity level of 10.
max-complexity = 10
```

As an example, the following would configure Ruff to: (1) enforce flake8-bugbear rules, in addition
to the defaults; (2) avoid enforcing line-length violations (`E501`); (3) avoid attempting to fix
flake8-bugbear (`B`) violations; and (3) ignore import-at-top-of-file violations (`E402`) in
`__init__.py` files:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Enable flake8-bugbear (`B`) rules.
select = ["E", "F", "B"]

# Never enforce `E501` (line length violations).
ignore = ["E501"]

# Avoid trying to fix flake8-bugbear (`B`) violations.
unfixable = ["B"]

# Ignore `E402` (import violations) in all `__init__.py` files, and in `path/to/file.py`.
[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
"__init__.py" = ["E402"]
"path/to/file.py" = ["E402"]
```

Plugin configurations should be expressed as subsections, e.g.:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Add "Q" to the list of enabled codes.
select = ["E", "F", "Q"]

[tool.ruff.flake8-quotes]
docstring-quotes = "double"
```

Ruff mirrors Flake8's rule code system, in which each rule code consists of a one-to-three letter
prefix, followed by three digits (e.g., `F401`). The prefix indicates that "source" of the rule
(e.g., `F` for Pyflakes, `E` for pycodestyle, `ANN` for flake8-annotations). The set of enabled
rules is determined by the `select` and `ignore` options, which support both the full code (e.g.,
`F401`) and the prefix (e.g., `F`).

As a special-case, Ruff also supports the `ALL` code, which enables all rules. Note that some of the
pydocstyle rules conflict (e.g., `D203` and `D211`) as they represent alternative docstring
formats. Enabling `ALL` without further configuration may result in suboptimal behavior, especially
for the pydocstyle plugin.

If you're wondering how to configure Ruff, here are some **recommended guidelines**:

* Prefer `select` and `ignore` over `extend-select` and `extend-ignore`, to make your rule set
  explicit.
* Use `ALL` with discretion. Enabling `ALL` will implicitly enable new rules whenever you upgrade.
* Start with a small set of rules (`select = ["E", "F"]`) and add a category at-a-time. For example,
  you might consider expanding to `select = ["E", "F", "B"]` to enable the popular flake8-bugbear
  extension.
* By default, Ruff's autofix is aggressive. If you find that it's too aggressive for your liking,
  consider turning off autofix for specific rules or categories (see: [FAQ](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#ruff-tried-to-fix-something-but-it-broke-my-code-what-should-i-do)).

### Configure via `ruff.toml`

As an alternative to `pyproject.toml`, Ruff will also respect a `ruff.toml` file, which implements
an equivalent schema (though the `[tool.ruff]` hierarchy can be omitted). For example, the
`pyproject.toml` described above would be represented via the following `ruff.toml`:

```toml
# Enable flake8-bugbear (`B`) rules.
select = ["E", "F", "B"]

# Never enforce `E501` (line length violations).
ignore = ["E501"]

# Avoid trying to fix flake8-bugbear (`B`) violations.
unfixable = ["B"]

# Ignore `E402` (import violations) in all `__init__.py` files, and in `path/to/file.py`.
[per-file-ignores]
"__init__.py" = ["E402"]
"path/to/file.py" = ["E402"]
```

For a full list of configurable options, see the [list of all options](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/).

### Command-line interface

Some configuration settings can be provided via the command-line, such as those related to
rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, logging level, and more:

```shell
ruff check path/to/code/ --select F401 --select F403 --quiet
```

### `pyproject.toml` discovery

Similar to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy),
Ruff supports hierarchical configuration, such that the "closest" `pyproject.toml` file in the
directory hierarchy is used for every individual file, with all paths in the `pyproject.toml` file
(e.g., `exclude` globs, `src` paths) being resolved relative to the directory containing the
`pyproject.toml` file.

There are a few exceptions to these rules:

1. In locating the "closest" `pyproject.toml` file for a given path, Ruff ignores any
   `pyproject.toml` files that lack a `[tool.ruff]` section.
2. If a configuration file is passed directly via `--config`, those settings are used for across
   files. Any relative paths in that configuration file (like `exclude` globs or `src` paths) are
   resolved relative to the _current working directory_.
3. If no `pyproject.toml` file is found in the filesystem hierarchy, Ruff will fall back to using
   a default configuration. If a user-specific configuration file exists
   at `${config_dir}/ruff/pyproject.toml`, that file will be used instead of the default
   configuration, with `${config_dir}` being determined via the [`dirs`](https://docs.rs/dirs/4.0.0/dirs/fn.config_dir.html)
   crate, and all relative paths being again resolved relative to the _current working directory_.
4. Any `pyproject.toml`-supported settings that are provided on the command-line (e.g., via
   `--select`) will override the settings in _every_ resolved configuration file.

Unlike [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy),
Ruff does not merge settings across configuration files; instead, the "closest" configuration file
is used, and any parent configuration files are ignored. In lieu of this implicit cascade, Ruff
supports an [`extend`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#extend) field, which allows you to inherit the settings from another
`pyproject.toml` file, like so:

```toml
# Extend the `pyproject.toml` file in the parent directory.
extend = "../pyproject.toml"
# But use a different line length.
line-length = 100
```

All of the above rules apply equivalently to `ruff.toml` files. If Ruff detects both a `ruff.toml`
and `pyproject.toml` file, it will defer to the `ruff.toml`.

### Python file discovery

When passed a path on the command-line, Ruff will automatically discover all Python files in that
path, taking into account the [`exclude`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#exclude) and
[`extend-exclude`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#extend-exclude) settings in each directory's
`pyproject.toml` file.

By default, Ruff will also skip any files that are omitted via `.ignore`, `.gitignore`,
`.git/info/exclude`, and global `gitignore` files (see: [`respect-gitignore`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#respect-gitignore)).

Files that are passed to `ruff` directly are always linted, regardless of the above criteria.
For example, `ruff check /path/to/excluded/file.py` will always lint `file.py`.

### Rule resolution

The set of enabled rules is controlled via the [`select`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#select)
and [`ignore`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#ignore) settings, along with the
[`extend-select`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#extend-select) and
[`extend-ignore`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#extend-ignore) modifiers.

To resolve the enabled rule set, Ruff may need to reconcile `select` and `ignore` from a variety
of sources, including the current `pyproject.toml`, any inherited `pyproject.toml` files, and the
CLI (e.g., `--select`).

In those scenarios, Ruff uses the "highest-priority" `select` as the basis for the rule set, and
then applies any `extend-select`, `ignore`, and `extend-ignore` adjustments. CLI options are given
higher priority than `pyproject.toml` options, and the current `pyproject.toml` file is given higher
priority than any inherited `pyproject.toml` files.

For example, given the following `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
select = ["E", "F"]
ignore = ["F401"]
```

Running `ruff check --select F401` would result in Ruff enforcing `F401`, and no other rules.

Running `ruff check --extend-select B` would result in Ruff enforcing the `E`, `F`, and `B` rules, with
the exception of `F401`.

### Suppressing errors

To omit a lint rule entirely, add it to the "ignore" list via [`ignore`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#ignore)
or [`extend-ignore`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#extend-ignore), either on the command-line
or in your `pyproject.toml` file.

To ignore a violation inline, Ruff uses a `noqa` system similar to [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/3.1.1/user/ignoring-errors.html).
To ignore an individual violation, add `# noqa: {code}` to the end of the line, like so:

```python
# Ignore F841.
x = 1  # noqa: F841

# Ignore E741 and F841.
i = 1  # noqa: E741, F841

# Ignore _all_ violations.
x = 1  # noqa
```

Note that, for multi-line strings, the `noqa` directive should come at the end of the string, and
will apply to the entire string, like so:

```python
"""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
"""  # noqa: E501
```

To ignore all violations across an entire file, add `# ruff: noqa` to any line in the file, like so:

```python
# ruff: noqa
```

To ignore a specific rule across an entire file, add `# ruff: noqa: {code}` to any line in the file,
like so:

```python
# ruff: noqa: F841
```

Or see the [`per-file-ignores`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#per-file-ignores) configuration
setting, which enables the same functionality via a `pyproject.toml` file.

Note that Ruff will also respect Flake8's `# flake8: noqa` directive, and will treat it as
equivalent to `# ruff: noqa`.

#### Automatic error suppression

Ruff supports several workflows to aid in `noqa` management.

First, Ruff provides a special rule code, `RUF100`, to enforce that your `noqa` directives are
"valid", in that the violations they _say_ they ignore are actually being triggered on that line (and
thus suppressed). You can run `ruff check /path/to/file.py --extend-select RUF100` to flag unused `noqa`
directives.

Second, Ruff can _automatically remove_ unused `noqa` directives via its autofix functionality.
You can run `ruff check /path/to/file.py --extend-select RUF100 --fix` to automatically remove unused
`noqa` directives.

Third, Ruff can _automatically add_ `noqa` directives to all failing lines. This is useful when
migrating a new codebase to Ruff. You can run `ruff check /path/to/file.py --add-noqa` to automatically
add `noqa` directives to all failing lines, with the appropriate rule codes.

#### Action comments

Ruff respects `isort`'s [action comments](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/action_comments.html)
(`# isort: skip_file`, `# isort: on`, `# isort: off`, `# isort: skip`, and `# isort: split`), which
enable selectively enabling and disabling import sorting for blocks of code and other inline
configuration.

See the [`isort` documentation](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/action_comments.html)
for more.

### Exit codes

By default, Ruff exits with the following status codes:

* `0` if no violations were found, or if all present violations were fixed automatically.
* `1` if violations were found.
* `2` if Ruff terminates abnormally due to invalid configuration, invalid CLI options, or an internal error.

This convention mirrors that of tools like ESLint, Prettier, and RuboCop.

Ruff supports two command-line flags that alter its exit code behavior:

* `--exit-zero` will cause Ruff to exit with a status code of `0` even if violations were found.
  Note that Ruff will still exit with a status code of `2` if it terminates abnormally.
* `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` will cause Ruff to exit with a status code of `1` if violations were
  found, _even if_ all such violations were fixed automatically. Note that the use of
  `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` can result in a non-zero exit code even if no violations remain after
  autofixing.

### Autocompletion

Ruff supports autocompletion for most shells. A shell-specific completion script can be generated
by `ruff generate-shell-completion <SHELL>`, where `<SHELL>` is one of `bash`, `elvish`, `fig`, `fish`,
`powershell`, or `zsh`.

The exact steps required to enable autocompletion will vary by shell. For example instructions,
see the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#enable-tab-completion-for-bash-fish-or-zsh) or
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#complete) documentation.

As an example: to enable autocompletion for Zsh, run
`ruff generate-shell-completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_ruff`. Then add the following line to your
`~/.zshrc` file, if they're not already present:

```zsh
fpath+=~/.zfunc
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

## Supported Rules

<!-- Begin section: Rules -->

Ruff supports over 400 lint rules, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8, isort,
pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule's origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.

By default, Ruff enables Flake8's `E` and `F` rules. Ruff supports all rules from the `F` category,
and a [subset](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#error-e) of the `E` category, omitting those
stylistic rules made obsolete by the use of an autoformatter, like [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

<!-- End section: Rules -->

For a complete enumeration, see the [list of rules](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/) in the
Ruff documentation.

## Acknowledgements

Ruff's linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [Pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes),
[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle),
[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort).

In some cases, Ruff includes a "direct" Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We're grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they've provided to the Python community.

Ruff's autoformatter is built on a fork of Rome's [`rome_formatter`](https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter),
and again draws on both the APIs and implementation details of [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of [contributors](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/graphs/contributors).
