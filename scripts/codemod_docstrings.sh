# This script uses the https://github.com/astral-sh/docstring-adder tool to codemod docstrings into our vendored typeshed stubs.
#
# We run the tool with the full matrix of Python versions supported by typeshed,
# so that we codemod in docstrings that only exist on certain versions.
#
# The codemod will only add docstrings to functions/classes that do not
# already have docstrings. We run with Python 3.14 before running with
# any other Python version so that we get the Python 3.14 version of the
# docstring for a definition that exists on all Python versions: if we
# ran with Python 3.9 first, then the later runs with Python 3.10+ would
# not modify the docstring that had already been added using the old version of Python.
#
# Note that the codemod can only add docstrings if they exist on the Python platform
# the codemod is run with. If you need to add docstrings for a Windows-specific API,
# you'll need to run the codemod on a Windows machine.
